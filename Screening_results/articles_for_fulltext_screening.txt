AB  - Background: The proportion of elderly patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) is increasing over time. Thoracoscopic extended thymectomy has been shown to achieve a superior short-term outcome to transsternal procedures. Therefore, the long-term clinical outcome should be re-examined, particularly in elderly patients. Methods: We evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes after extended thymectomy in 30 MG patients with or without thymoma. Twenty-one (70%) patients underwent surgery by 65 years of age, and the remaining 9 (30%) underwent surgery after 65 years of age. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the influence of various factors on the improvement in MG symptoms. Results: The characteristics in the elderly patients were comparable to those in the younger patients, except for the age at surgery. Symptoms of MG improved in 4 of the 9 (44%) elderly patients and in 18 of the 21 (86%) younger patients (P=0.0192). One elderly patient who underwent transsternal thymectomy died suddenly on postoperative day 3, probably due to a MG crisis: no pathological abnormalities were detected by an autopsy. A multivariate analysis identified an age at thymectomy of <65 years (P=0.0237) and a duration from the onset to thymectomy of <1 year (P=0.0405) as independent factors associated with the improvement of MG symptoms. Indeed, 4 of the 5 (80%) elderly patients who underwent thymectomy within 1 year after the onset had a favorable long-term outcome. Conclusions: Thymectomy can be an option even in elderly patients, provided the operation is performed early after the onset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate transcervical and transsternal thymectomy benefits in large myasthenia gravis (MG) cohort. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated MG patients (n = 184) who had undergone thymectomy between 2004 and 2015 at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore (India). Myasthenia gravis foundation of America guidelines were followed to assess clinical outcome. Anti-acetylcholine receptors (AChR) antibodies, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and Neostigmine tests were performed at pre and post-thymectomy stage. RESULTS: Most of the patients were fell under MG grade IIA (82 of 184, 44.56%) and grade IIB (61 of 184, 33.15%). Thymoma and thymic hyperplasia was established in 64 (34.78%) and 89 (48.37%) patients respectively. Other thymic abnormalities such thymic atrophy, cysts and lipoma were established in 31 (16.85%) patients. MG patients were treated either with transcervical (n = 79) or (n = 105) transsternal thymectomy. At the pre-thymectomy stage, the majority of the patients were positive for anti-AChR antibodies (179 of 184, 97.28%), RNS (170 of 184, 92.4%), and Neostigmine (175 of 184, 95.11%). At the post-thymectomy stage, a significant reduction observed in anti-AChR antibodies positivity (p < 0.022) and RNS positivity (p < 0.015). Overall, benefits were observed in 61.41% (113 of 184) of patients. Clinical benefits (complete stable remission, pharmacological remission, minimal manifestation, and improvement) of transcervical and transsternal thymectomy observed in 69.62% (55 of 79) and 55.24% (58 of 105) of patients respectively. MG patients with thymoma showed the least improvement compared to thymic hyperplasia. DISCUSSION: Transcervical and transsternal thymectomy showed clinical benefits, however, there was no significant difference between them.

AB  - Background: Minimally invasive thymectomy is fast becoming the preferred approach for myasthenia gravis and non-invasive thymoma. The most commonly employed approach for minimally invasive thymectomy is the lateral thoracic approach. Safe achievement of radical resection requires adequate visualisation of both the phrenic nerves along their entire course. In our experience, such visualisation is rather difficult with unilateral transthoracic approaches. We herein describe our technique and initial experience of 25 cases with subxiphoid robotic thymectomy (SRT) for myasthenia gravis with or without thymoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such report from India. Subjects and Methods: We retrospectively analysed data of patients who underwent SRT at our centre from June 2017 to September 2018. Twenty-five consecutive patients were analysed, and demographic data, total duration of the procedure, console time, blood transfusion requirement, duration of chest drainage, length of hospital stay, pain score on post-operative day (POD) 1 and day of discharge and post-operative morbidity and mortality within 90 days were recorded. Results: A total of 25 patients underwent SRT. All our patients had myasthenia gravis with 4 of them having thymoma. There were 11 males and 14 females with mean age of 29.30 years (range 23-48). The mean console time was 102.85 min (range 88-120) while the mean total operative time was 199.14 (range 180-220). On first POD 1, visual analogue scale score average was 5, and at discharge, it was 2. There was no 30-day or 90-day mortality. All cases of thymoma had a complete R0 resection. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that subxiphoid approach offers a good operative view of the thymus in cervical region along with easy identification of bilateral phrenic nerves. Thus, SRT can be performed safely with comparable results.

AB  - Compared to the intercostal approach, subxiphoid uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is considered to be less invasive as it may cause minimal postoperative pain. Besides, it provides an excellent view of the bilateral pleural cavities. In this paper, we describe our technique and overview a 2-year experience results in this approach for the surgical treatment of anterior mediastinal and pulmonary lesions. In a retrospective study of data collected prospectively between October 2014 and December 2016, 38 patients underwent surgery for an anterior mediastinal tumor or myasthenia gravis at our institution. Intraoperative factors like duration of operation and amount of blood loss were analyzed as well as postoperative ones, including duration of chest drains, amount of postoperative fluid drainage, and length of hospital stay. The median age of patients was 59years (36-80 years) with 19 females (50%). Overall, 28 patients (74%) underwent extended thymectomy. Seven patients (19%) experienced a combined lung resection and extended thymectomy, 3 (7%) a resection of pericardial (2) or bronchogenic (1) cysts. The median diameter of the lesions was 2.93cm (1.2-7.7 cm). Postoperatively, 30-day mortality was 0%. Subxiphoid uniportal VATS is a convenient approach for minimally invasive mediastinal surgery. The excellent exposure of the anterior mediastinum and the possibility of conducting complex procedures, such as extended thymectomies and combined mediastinal and pulmonary resections with good results of minimal morbidity, represent the strong points of this technique. Thoracic surgeons experienced in VATS can safely perform subxiphoid uniportal VATS for mediastinal surgery.

AB  - Background: Thymectomy is an effective treatment for Myasthenia Gravis in the adult population. Surgical removal of the thymus can be performed through several approaches. Comparison of the most commonly used surgical techniques through randomized control trials with long-term follow-up is scarce. Objective: To comparatively analyze long-term results and complications of transcervical (TCT) and transsternal thymectomy (TST) in a randomized controlled trial with a mean follow-up of ten years. Results: A total of 100 patients were randomized to transsternal thymectomy (50), and transcervical procedure (50). There were not significant differences in the demographic characteristics, MGFA clinical classification, and MGFA therapy status between groups before surgery. Twenty patients were lost of follow up during the first year and were excluded. Our final group included 40 patients in each group. Three patients in TCT group (7.5%) and 6 patients in the TST group (15%) developed surgical complications. At 1 year of follow-up, 7 patients (17.5%) of the TCT group were asymptomatic in comparison with 15 patients (37.5%) of group TST, after 10 years of follow-up, 26 cases (72.9%) in group TCT were asymptomatic in comparison with 29 cases (80.5%) of group TST. Outcomes 10 years after surgery by MGFA post-intervention status showed that complete stable remission was achieved in 8 (21.6%) patients of the TCT group, and in 20 patients (55.5%) of the TST group. Conclusions: Transcervical and transsternal thymectomy are safe and result in significant improvement of patients with Myasthenia Gravis. TST has superior results in terms of complete stable remission at 10 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymoma is frequently associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). However, whether MG is a factor for the outcome of patients with thymoma following complete thymectomy remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of thymoma with MG prognostic factors. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of The Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) database within 1992-2012 complete cases 875 cases, 20 years follow-up data analysis thymic tumor tissue type credits and MG, Masaoka staging and prognosis, postoperative adjuvant therapy and relationship with the prognosis of surgical removal of the way. RESULTS: Thymic tumor tissue type credit has correlation with MG, difference was statistically significant (chi2=24.908, P<0.001). MG: incidence of B2 type (58/178, 32.58%) > B3 type (65/239, 27.20%) > B1 (27/132, 20.45%) > AB (43/267, 16.10%) > type A, 10.17% (6/59), Masaoka stage has no correlation with MG (chi2=0.365, P=1.365). Survival analysis showed that the WHO classification, Masaoka stage associated with prognosis (P<0.05), and whether the merger MG (chi2=0.113, P=0.736), postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (chi2=0.380, P=0.538) has nothing to do with the prognosis, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with poor prognosis (chi2=14.417, P<0.001). Whether has nothing to do with the prognosis of the thymus resection (chi2=1.548, P=1.548), whether the whole correlated with the curative effect of thymus excision with MG (chi2=24.695, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Thymoma patients with MG and extended thymectomy have no correlation with prognosis. Extended thymectomy can improve the effect of MG patients.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the long-term clinical outcomes, including complete remission rate, and the prognostic factors after thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 183 patients with generalised myasthenia gravis who underwent thymectomy from January 1993 to December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 113 patients had complete follow-up for more than 10 years that could be enrolled for long term complete stable remission rate analysis. 42 cases (23%) were male patients and 141 cases (77%) were female patients. Preoperative and postoperative patient evaluations were based on MGFA classification, including complete stable remission, minimal manifestation, improved, unchanged and worsening. Complete remission was defined as the patient being asymptomatic with normal strength without medication at a 10-year follow-up. Result(s): Trans-sternal thymectomy was performed in 94% of patients. Histological analysis revealed 62% of patients had thymic hyperplasia and 14% of patients had thymoma. According to MGFA postoperative statuses, complete stable remission was presented in 47.5%, minimal manifestation in 12%, improved in 31%, unchanged in 5.5%, and worsening in 1.6%. The complete stable remission rate at a 10-year follow-up was 51%. There were no significant prognosis factors for complete stable remission. Conclusion(s): Trans-sternal thymectomy is an effective modality of treatment which is associated with highly complete stable long term remission rates for patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.

AB  - Background: MGTX, the Thymectomy Trial in Non-thymomatous Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Patients Receiving Corticosteroids, was the firstever randomized, rater-blinded study of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis (MG). The international trial addressed questions regarding the efficacy of thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG that had persisted for 75 years since use of the procedure was first reported by Blalock and colleagues in 1941. Method(s): MGTX was designed to answer three questions: does the combination of alternate-day prednisone and extended transsternal thymectomy after 3 years compared to an identical dosing protocol of prednisone alone, (1) lead to better outcomes in MG as measured by a time-weighted average of the Quantitative MG Score (QMG), (2) reduce the time-weighted average alternate-day prednisone requirements, and (3) reduce side-effect burdens on patients primarily arising from medications used to treat the disease? Patients age 18 to 65 years with generalized non-thymomatous acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive MG of less than 5 years dura tion and MG Foundation of America Clinical Classification 2 to 4 were enrolled. Dual primary outcomes were the time-weighted average of the Quantitative MG (QMG) score and prednisone dose over 3 years. Result(s): A total of 126 MG patients underwent randomization at 36 sites. Subjects who underwent thymectomy showed significant improvements in MG status (time-weighted average QMG 6.15 vs. 8.99, p<0.001) and reduced alternateday prednisone requirements (32 mg vs. 54 mg, p<0.001) at 3 years with benefits observed as early as 9 to 12 months. The ability to withdraw completely from prednisone and remain off it at 3 years also favored the surgical arm (58% vs. 20%, p<0.01). The ability to withdraw from prednisone did not correlate with duration of disease, or age at MG onset or trial enrollment. Histological analysis of thymic follicular hyperplasia, seen in 67% of surgical patients, failed to correlate with the timeweighted QMG or prednisone exposure. However, intra-thymic fat content directly correlated with time-weighted prednisone exposure (p=0.004). On secondary outcomes, fewer patients who had thymectomy required immunosuppression with azathioprine (17% vs. 48%, p<0.001) or were hospitalized for exacerbations (9% vs. 37%, p<0.001). The number of patients with treatment-associated complications did not differ significantly between groups (p=0.73), but the thymectomy group had fewer treatment-associated symptoms (p<0.001) and lower distress levels related to symptoms (p=0.003). MG-Activities of Daily Living scale and the proportion of patients reaching Minimal Manifestation Status also significantly favored the surgical arm. Conclusion(s): MGTX provided a definitive answer sought by the MG community since the middle of the last century. Extended transsternal thymectomy performed within the first 5 years of disease improves clinical outcomes, reduces immunosuppressive medication requirements, and decreases side-effect burdens in generalized acetylcholine receptor antibody- positive MG patients without thymoma. This group represents the largest subpopulation of MG patients. Although the MGTX trial did not test less-invasive approaches for removing the thymus gland which have become increasingly popular over the last two decades, one can surmise that less invasive approaches that completely replicate the maximal tissue resection performed in an extended transsternal thymectomy would confer similar benefits for patients.

AB  - Background: Complete thymectomy is recommended for thymic malignancies to reduce local recurrence and the likelihood of the long-term development of myasthenia gravis (MG). Thymus-conserving surgery (thymomectomy) seems to yield similar results, but evidence is still limited. The objective of this study was to assess if the oncological outcome, in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), are comparable between radical thymectomy vs. conservative thymomectomy patients, and to assess if the outcome of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach was similar to open surgery approach. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 157 consecutive patients with either resectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma from two Italian centers (Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, and Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo) between 1997 and 2013 who underwent thymomectomy or extended thymectomy with the VATS or open approach; the patients with Miastenia Gravis underwent radical thymectomy. The patients were followed through physical examinations and phone interviews. Results: Thymomectomy and thymectomy were performed on 86 (54.8%) and 71 (45.2%) patients, respectively. Prognostic factors and comorbidities were comparable in the two groups. The median follow-up was 77 months. Cox proportional hazards model revealed that Masaoka advanced stage and thymic carcinoma of WHO classification were independent predictive factors for overall survival, but that the extent of surgery and the approach used (minimally invasive versus open) were not. Notably, five- and ten-year survival rates were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: In our experience, radical thymectomy and conservative thymomectomy did not differ in terms of disease-free and overall survival rates. In nonmyasthenic patients with early-stage resectable thymic malignancy, minimally invasive thymomectomy provided equivalent results to open thymectomy. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective nature of the study. Well-designed, adequately-powered studies should be very welcome to increase the quantity and the quality of clinical evidence before incorporating this procedure in future guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is an effective treatment option for long-term remission of myasthenia gravis. The superiority of the trans-sternal and thoracoscopic surgical approaches is still being debated. The aims of this study are to compare postoperative outcomes and neurologic outcomes between the two approaches and to identify prognostic factors for complete stable remission (CSR). METHODS: Myasthenia gravis patients who underwent thymectomy with trans-sternal or thoracoscopic approach in MahaRaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand between January1, 2006 and December 31, 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The endpoints were postoperative outcomes and cumulative incidence function for CSR. The analysis was performed using multilevel model, Cox's proportional hazard model, and propensity score. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled in this study: 53 in the thoracoscopic group and 45 in the trans-sternal group. There were no significant differences between groups in composite postoperative complications, surgical time, ventilator support days, and length of intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative blood loss and length of hospital stay were significant less in the thoracoscopic group. The CSR and median time to remission were not significantly different between the two approaches. Prognostic factors for CSR were nonthymoma (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-12.22) and presence of pharmacological remission (hazard ratio: 24.3, 95% confidence interval: 3.27-180.41). CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic thymectomy is safe and provides good neurologic outcomes in comparison to the trans-sternal approach. Two predictive factors should be considered for CSR. Further prospective studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period are warranted to confirm these results.

AB  - Background: We have used a promising, minimally invasive thoracoscopic technique of extended thymectomy for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The aim of this study was to report our promising technique, a modified single-port trans-subxiphoid approach (MTXA) and to compare perioperative outcomes and effects on MG between our approach and sternotomy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all patients undergoing extended thymectomy for MG and/or thymoma between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016. The patients were divided into the MTXA group and Sternotomy group. Results: Of the 50 consecutive patients undergoing extended thymectomy for MG, finally, 13 patients undergoing our MTXA extended thymectomy technique were compared with 20 patients undergoing extended thymectomy via sternotomy. Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative length of stay, and C-reactive protein value on postoperative day 1 were significantly more favorable in the MTXA group than the Sternotomy group (P<0.0001, P=0.0040 and P=0.0073, respectively). Furthermore, no significant differences in the frequency of patients with improvement of their Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score and/or MG-Activities of Daily Living scale, decrease in the serum level of acetylcholine receptor antibody, and dose reduction of oral prednisone were seen between the two groups. Conclusions: Our approach to extended thymectomy might be more favorable than sternotomy in patients with MG.

AB  - Background: The aim of study is to analyze the inter-relationship among WHO histology, myasthenia gravis (MG) and Masaoka stage and to assess the feasibility of thoracoscopic surgery in thymoma patients. Methods: Data from 142 consecutive thymoma patients from January 2009 to March 2016 were retrospectively reviewed in our institution. Histological classification and clinical staging were assessed by WHO histology criteria and Masaoka stage. We investigated the clinical characteristics, inter-relationship among WHO histology, MG and Masaoka stage, and compared the feasibility and safety of thoracoscopic thymectomy by comparison of open thymectomy. Results: Among 142 patients, the incidence of MG was 29.6%. Compared with A and AB-type thymomas, a higher prevalence of advance clinical stage was in B1 to C-type thymomas (37/63 vs. 9/43, P<0.001), and there was an increased trend of Masaoka stage from A to C-type thymomas (P<0.001). The incidence of MG was significantly higher in AB, B1 and B2-type thymomas than other type thymomas (23/63 vs. 6/44, P=0.009) and in early Masaoka clinical stage than advanced Masaoka clinical stage (29/80 vs. 12/59, P=0.042). Thoracoscopic surgery could significantly decrease blood loss in patients with (104.06+/-137.36 vs. 350.91+/-560.79 mL, P=0.001) or without MG (91.90+/-77.70 vs. 266.32+/-292.60 mL, P=0.02), with comparable complications. Additionally, thoracoscopic surgery could achieve an equal effect on the remission of MG with open surgery (7/11 vs. 10/14, P=1.000), and Masaoka stage was significantly associated with the remission of MG after thymectomy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that WHO histology, MG, and Masaoka stage interrelate with one another, and Masaoka stage is an important prognostic factor in remission of MG after thymectomy in thymoma patients. Thoracoscopic thymectomy could achieve an equal efficacy to open thymectomy and should be recommended as a routine surgery for patients with early Masaoka stage.

AB  - Background: There are different surgical techniques used for thymectomy. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, using a less invasive approach would provide a better outcome. Method(s): From June 2015 to February 2017, a prospective study included a total number of 50 patients of non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) who were randomly divided into two groups: group A (25 patients who underwent VATS thymectomy), and group B (25 patients who underwent thymectomy via ministernotomy). Efficacy and outcome of both procedures were compared. Patients were followed-up for at least one year postoperatively. Result(s): Both procedures were safe and effective in the management of MG. There was no significant difference between both groups regarding preoperative data. In VATS group, there were significant decreased operative times (p value = 0.00), significant decreased blood loss (p value = 0.039), significant decreased postoperative respiratory and cardiac complications (p value = 0.025 and 0.018 respectively) and significant shorter length of ICU and hospital stays (p value = 0.039 and 0.007 respectively) when compared to ministernotomy group. There was no statistically significant difference between both groups regarding complete stable remissions and clinical improvement. No mortality was recorded in both groups. Conclusion(s): Thoracoscopic thymectomy should be the technique of choice in the management of MG. It has better intraoperative and short-term results than that of thymectomy via ministernotomy. However, longer periods of follow-up is needed to evaluate long-term results properly. Copyright © 2018 The Egyptian Society of Cardio-thoracic Surgery

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is a reliable surgical method for treating patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and benign tumors of the thymus. Despite the advantages of minimally invasive surgical approaches for resection of thymic neoplasms, there are still controversies regarding the superiority of one type of surgery over another. OBJECTIVES: To report the results of our initial Israeli experience with robotic thymectomy in 22 patients with MG and suspected benign thymic tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 22 patients (10 men, 12 women) who underwent robotic thymectomy by a left-sided (16) or right-sided approach (6) using the da Vinci robotic system at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center. Seven patients were diagnosed with MG before surgery and 14 had suspected benign thymic neoplasms. RESULTS: Average operative time was 90 minutes. There were no deaths or intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications occurred in two patients (dyspnea and pleural effusion). Median blood loss was 12.3 cc (range 5-35 cc), median hospital stay 2.9 days (range 2-5 days), and mean weight of resected thymus 32.1 grams. Seven patients had thymic hyperplasia, six a lipothymoma, one a thymic cyst. Seven each had thymomas in different stages and one had a cavernous hemangioma. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic thymectomy is a safe, technically effective surgical method for resection of thymic neoplasms. The advantages of this technique are safety, short hospitalization period, little blood loss, and low complications. We have included this surgical procedure in our thoracic surgery residency program and recommend a learning curve program of 10 to 12 procedures during residency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence supports the efcacy of extended transsternal thymectomy in improvement of clinical outcomes in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG). Despite less rigorous evidence, minimally invasive thymectomy techniques are frequently performed. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze perspectives regarding thymectomy utilization in the management of MG, and to identify factors that may infuence practice trends. METHOD(S): A questionnaire addressing perceptions and practices of thymectomy was developed and distributed to neurologists through links on web-based forums. Cross tabulations were carried out by demographic factors and groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULT(S): The majority of 56 neurologists responded that they believe thymectomy results in improved clinical outcomes (69.5%) and that maximal and minimal techniques are equally effective (61.8%). Among those who consider the approaches to be unequal, maximal approaches are regarded superior (37.2% versus 5.5%; p=0.0004); this is associated with surgical availability (p=0.03). Only 19.6% of those who consider maximal approach to be superior endorse recommending maximal thymectomy for their patients, with all demographic associations being nonsignifcant. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive thymectomies continue to be utilized in the management of non-thymomatous MG, despite the lack of high-grade evidence supporting longterm clinical improvement. This study indicates that the majority of neurologists consider both approaches to surgery to be equally effective, and that neurologists are unlikely to recommend the maximal approach, even if they believe it will result in a better outcome. In the context of a paucity of evidence, these trends warrant further investigation.

AB  - Background: The approaches to thoracoscopic thymectomy in myasthenia gravis (MG) are debatable. We developed a novel approach via subxiphoid and subcostal arch, with a significantly shorter duration of operation and hospital stay, less estimated blood loss, and lower postoperative pain. Methods: From December 2012 to December 2014, 77 myasthenia gravis patients with or without thymoma underwent thoracoscopic extended thymectomy at our hospital. Among them, 41 patients were operated via the subxiphoid and subcostal arch approach and the other 36 via the conventional unilateral approach. The patient outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. Results: The thoracoscopic extended thymectomy was performed safely via the subxiphoid and subcostal arch approach. In this approach, no drainage tube was inserted after operation except in the first two patients. Two of the 41 patients were switched to trans-sternal approach due to the tight adhesion between the thymoma and the left innominate vein. No major complications occurred. Compared with the unilateral approach, the duration of the procedure via subxiphoid and subcostal arch was significantly shorter, with less estimated blood loss, shorter hospital-stay and lower postoperative pain (P<0.001). The cosmetic scores were comparable between the two groups (P=0.369). Conclusions: The novel subxiphoid and subcostal arch approach is technically feasible and safe. It is an acceptable alternative to conventional thoracoscopic extended thymectomy.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of R0 resection of thymoma to identify prognostic factors for long-term outcomes. Method(s): Data of 62 patients (28 male, 34 female) with a mean age of 47.26 +/- 14.42 years, who underwent R0 resection for thymoma and were followed-up between February 2004 and March 2016, were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Eight patients had a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy and 54 had a transsternal extended thymectomy. During a mean follow-up of 128.67 +/- 7.95 months, regional recurrence of thymoma was observed in 9 (14.5%) patients. Overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 85.36% and 78.20%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year survival rates in patients aged < 50 years were significantly better than in those aged >= 50 years (92% and 72% vs. 88% and 39%, p < 0.0001). The 10-year overall survival of patients in Masaoka stage I and II was better than those in stage III (88.9%, 78.4%, 69.8%, respectively, log-rank p < 0.001). The 10-year survival of patients with World Health Organization histological type A, AB, and B1 thymomas was better than those with type B2 and B3 (log-rank test p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age < 50 years (p = 0.001), Masaoka stage (p = 0.006), histological type (p = 0.001), and recurrence (p = 0.04) were independent prognostic factors for survival. Conclusion(s): Our study indicates that age < 50 years, Masaoka stage, histological type, and recurrence are the determinants of survival in surgically resected cases of thymoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) benefits from thymectomy. However, its unpredictable response to muscle relaxants and volatile anesthetic agents may result in muscle weakness and subsequently in postoperative myasthenic crisis. The aim of this study was to determine the surgical outcomes after spontaneous ventilation compared with conventional intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (spontaneous-ventilation video-assisted thoracic thymectomy [SV-VATT] vs intubated video-assisted thoracic thymectomy) in patients with MG. METHODS: Data from all minimally invasive thymectomy procedures performed at our institute between January 2009 and June 2016 were collected. Patient characteristics, perioperative results, and treatment outcomes between SV-VATT (group 1) and the intubated video-assisted thoracic thymectomy (group 2) groups were compared. Furthermore, a propensity score-matching analysis was generated to control for selection bias due to nonrandom group assignment in a 1:1 manner. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in group 1 and 68 in group 2. Matching of patients according to propensity score resulted in a cohort that consisted of 27 patients in both groups. Patients had similar clinical characteristics in both groups. Operating time (P = .07) and lowest pulse oxygen saturation (P = .09) between the procedures were comparable after matching, but peak CO<sub>2</sub> level at the end of expiration was significantly greater in group 1 both before and after matching (P < .01). Moreover, the incidence of postoperative myasthenic crisis and postoperative prolonged tracheal intubation was lower in group 1. The postoperative pain visual analog scale score (P < .01) and the length of hospital stay (P = .03) were shorter in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: SV-VATT is a feasible procedure in patients with MG. It might be beneficial by reducing postoperative myasthenic crisis and postoperative prolonged tracheal intubation. Further prospective research is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been increasingly used in the management of thymic epithelial tumours. However, its oncological efficacy remains to be proved. The purpose of this study is to compare the oncological outcomes following thoracoscopic versus open surgery in the case-matched groups of patients with early-stage thymic tumours from the Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) retrospective database. METHODS: Between 1994 and 2012, a total of 1087 patients who underwent surgery for UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) pathological Stage I tumours from the ChART retrospective database were recruited for this study. A propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare the long-term outcomes in patients who received VATS or open surgery. RESULTS: VATS resection was performed in 271 patients (24.9%) and open surgery in 816 patients (75.1%). Before propensity score matching, the VATS group had a smaller tumour size (P = 0.002), lower grade histology (P = 0.034), lower T stage (P < 0.001) and less adjuvant therapy (P < 0.001). Propensity score matching by gender, myasthenia gravis, tumour size, histological classification, pathological T stage, extent of thymectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy identified 110 patients in each group. After matching, there was no significant difference in patient demographics, tumour characteristics or adjuvant therapy. All matched patients had R0 resection. Overall survival, disease-free survival and cumulative incidence of recurrence were only predicted by WHO histology, but not by surgical approach, in both univariable and multivariable analyses. There was no significant difference in the overall survival (85.7% vs 93.1%, P = 0.539), disease-free survival (92.5% vs 91.9%, P = 0.773), cumulative incidence of recurrence (7.1% vs 5.8%, P = 0.522) and improvement rate of myasthenia gravis (83.3% vs 88.2%, P = 0.589) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: This propensity score-matched study suggests that VATS and open surgeries are associated with similar oncological outcomes for Stage I thymic epithelial tumours. Minimally invasive surgery might be an acceptable surgical approach for early-stage thymic malignancies.

AB  - Introduction: Thymectomy is the preferred standard treatment in younger non-thymoma patients with myasthenia gravis as well as in patients with early stage thymoma. Total thymectomy by median sternotomy has been the surgical approach since resection of the thymus with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Aim: To compare the clinical outcomes of VATS thymectomy with conventional open thymectomy for neoplastic and non-neoplastic thymic diseases. Material and methods: Forty patients underwent thymectomy between October 2012 and January 2016. Fifteen patients were male and 25 patients were female. The mean age was 40.3 +/-17.7 years. Seventeen (55%) patients underwent VATS thymectomy and 23 (45%) patients underwent an open procedure. We retrospectively reviewed the data of the patients and compared these two techniques. Results: The mean tumor size was 5.17 +/-3.2 cm in the thymoma group (VATS 2.5 +/-2.4 cm vs. open access 4.7 +/-3.7 cm). None of the patients experienced a myasthenic crisis. Conversion to thoracotomy was required in 1 patient in the VATS group due to bleeding from the right internal mammary artery; therefore, the conversion rate was 2.5% among all the patients. No mortality occurred in either group. No significant difference was found in the perioperative blood loss, operative time or pain visual analogue scale scores. On the other hand, regarding postoperative drainage, duration of chest tube drainage and length of hospital stay, VATS thymectomy yielded better results and the differences were significant. Conclusions: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery thymectomy can be performed for both neoplastic and non-neoplastic thymic diseases with minimal morbidity and mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thymectomy considered as a standard procedure in treatment of all the steps of myasthenia gravis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy is one of the minimally invasive procedures that because of the short duration of hospitalization, less postoperative pain, and scar after surgery, nowadays it is replaced the traditional methods of surgery for patients with myasthenia gravis, but there are still differences and concerns. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of two different techniques of surgery, VATS versus transsternal (TS) in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. METHODS: In this pilot study, 42 patients with myasthenia gravis and without a thymus tumor were evaluated based on Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classification and drug consumption. Then, they randomly underwent two different techniques of surgery: VATS versus TS. Patients were evaluated based on preoperative and postoperative variables. RESULTS: Duration of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization has been reduced in patients who underwent VATS thymectomy operation technique. In addition, duration of surgical procedure has been reduced significantly in these patients. These patients have less blood loss during surgery compared with TS group. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America postoperative status in VATS thymectomy revealed that the number of patients with complete stable remission was higher and number of persons remained unchanged was lower in this group. CONCLUSIONS: VATS thymectomy is a safe and appropriate approach comparing with traditional methods such as TS thymectomy for patients with myasthenia gravis. This method has better results after surgery and can be used as a minimally invasive alternative method instead of TS thymectomy.

AB  - The types of tumors in the medial mediastinal area were different. Thymoma, germ cell tumors, ectopic parathyroid tumors, and lymphoid tumors were in the anterior mediastinum. Bronchial cysts, pericardial cysts, and lymphomas were in the middle mediastinum. The principles of treatment for mediastinal tumor surgery must be both safe and radical. Radical resection is the dominant position in the treatment of mediastinal tumors, including traditional open surgery and thoracoscopic assisted minimally invasive surgery. At present, minimally invasive surgery for mediastinal tumor includes video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery via subxiphoid approach, left or right intercostal approach, trans-cervical approach and "Da Vinci" robotic system. Compared with conventional sternotomy, thoracoscopic assisted minimally invasive mediastinal tumor resection has clearer, multi-angle surgical vision, less trauma, less intraoperative blood loss, early postoperative extubation, and short postoperative hospital stay, postoperative recovery faster, less pain, fewer complications and meet the beauty needs and so on. Thoracoscopic assisted mediastinal thymectomy is currently one of the most commonly used surgical methods, but there are some deficiencies. Minimally invasive surgery through the subxiphoid approach can achieve a good surgical field of vision. Compared with the traditional transcostal VATS medial mediastinal tumor resection, the subxiphoid thoracoscopic surgery had obvious advantages: (1) The surgical field is fully exposed. For patients with myasthenia gravis, it is particularly necessary to clean bilateral mediastinal adipose tissue; (2) Without intercostal surgery, damage to intercostal nerves can be avoided, postoperative pain can be reduced, and quality of life can be improved; (3) Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative Extubation time is similar to VATS. Disadvantages are as follows: (1) If there is a large hemorrhage during surgery, an emergency transfer to open the chest is required. The injury is greater and the operation is more troublesome; (2) Anterior septal space is Smaller, surgical instruments are more likely to interfere with each other. But there is still lack of evidence to prove which is better. In this study, 100 patients with anterial and middle mediastinal tumors were selected as study subjects. 50 patients undergoing subxiphoid uniportal VATS were included in the observation group, and 50 patients undergoing intercostal uniportal VATS were included in the control group. The operation time, incision length, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage time, postoperative drainage, hospitalization and hospitalization costs of the 2 groups would be observed. The clinical efficacy and incidence of complications were compared between the 2 groups. After six months of follow-up, postoperative pain and postoperative quality of life were observed in the 2 groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive thoracic procedures are those performed through the intercostal, subxiphoid, subcostal or transcervical incisions. In most of these procedures (with exception of some transcervical procedures) the video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) technique is used for performance of an operation under guidance of a video monitor. METHODS: According to the definition the minimally invasive procedures do not include the sternal manubriotomy (upper sternal split), transverse sternotomy and subcutaneous longitudinal sternotomy. Currently, a minimally invasive extended thymectomy became a widespread procedure advised for nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) and early-stage thymomas. The definition of an extended thymectomy is a removal of the whole thymus with the surrounding adipose tissue. Instead of the term "extended thymectomy" some authors recommended a term "complete thymectomy", which means total removal of the whole thymus, without the adjacent fatty tissue. RESULTS: There are a lot of doubts about the definition of extended thymectomy. There have been no prospective randomized trials comparing the transsternal and minimally invasive approaches for MG or thymomas. Possible scenarios for such trials are analyzed in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: There are several issues of a minimally invasive thymectomy for MG and thymomas necessitating further clarifications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the results of minimally invasive surgery in patients with stage I or II thymoma in the Masaoka classification. The reference technique is partial or complete thymectomy by sternotonomy. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of a prospective database including all cases of thymoma operated from April 2009 to February 2015 by minimally invasive techniques: either videosurgery (VATS) or robot-assisted surgery (RATS). The surgical technique, type of resection, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and recurrences were analysed. RESULTS: Our series consisted of 22 patients (15 women and 7 men). The average age was 53 years. Myasthenia gravis was present in 12 patients. Eight patients were operated on by VATS and 14 patiens by RATS. There were no conversions to sternotomy and no perioperative deaths. The mean operating time was 92min for VATS and 137min for RATS (P<0.001). The average hospital stay was 5 days. The mean weight of the specimen for the VATS group was 13.2 and 45.7mg for the RATS group. Twelve patients were classified Masaoka stage I and 10 were stage II. According to the WHO classification there were 7 patients type A, 5 type AB, 4 type B1, 4 type B2 4 and 2 type B3. As proposed by the Group ITMIG-IASLC in 2015 all patients corresponded to group I. The mean follow-up period was 36 months. We noted 3 major perioperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification: one pneumonia, one phrenic nerve paralysis and one recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. We observed one case of local recurrence at 22 months. Following surgery 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive route is safe, relatively atraumatic and may be incorporated in the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of Masaoka stage I and II thymoma as an alternative to conventional sternotomy. RATS and VATS are two minimally invasive techniques and the results in the short and medium term are acceptable. The clinical advantages of one over the other are sifficult to establish. RATS could handle larger and more complex lesions in view of the weight and size of the operating instrument.

AB  - Background. Thymomas are rare neoplasms arising from tissue elements of the thymus. The objective of the study was to analyse clinical characteristics of patients with thymoma, as well as morphological and patohistological features of neoplasms. Methods: Retrospectively we studied 41 medical records and patohistological material of patients reffered to the Institute for pulmonary diseases of Vojvodina between the January 2005 and December 2014. Results: Patient age at presentation ranged from 19 to 77 years. A slight female preponderance was detected, with 24 (58.5%) females and 17 (41.5%) males being affected. All types of thymoma more often occured in males, accept subtype B1. Patients with type A thymoma and subtype B1 were mainly asymptomatic, while patients with subtype B2 and type AB presented with dyspnea, dysphagia, pain and cough. Myasthenia gravis often was associated with type A (40%). The most common histologic type was subtype B1. Twenty three (56%) patients had a tumor diameter between 5 and 10 cm. Five patients had malignant thymoma, and the most common types of thymoma that showed signs of capsula invasion or pleural and pericardial implants were type AB (60%) and subtype B2 (50%). Biopsies of suspected tissue were obtained through a sternotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery, and video-assisted mini thoracotomy, and after setting a diagnosis on ex tempore analysis, the lesions were removed by thymectomy or extirpation of the tumor mass. Conclusion: Thymomas have variable clinical presentations. Clinical outcome correlates with histological type, size and clinical stage, as well as the ability to achieve complete tumor resection.

AB  - Objectives: Evidence of benefits of thymectomy by complete sternotomy in the treatment of non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) was recently proven by a multicentre randomized trial. Several recent papers proposed different minimally invasive surgical approaches for the treatment of MG and compared them with the classic complete sternotomy. Nevertheless, the best procedure is still matter of debate. The aim of our study is to compare clinical outcomes of the available minimally invasive approaches: cervicotomy with upper sternotomy (C-US), video-assisted (VATS) and robotic-assisted (RATS) thoracic surgery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 267 consecutive nonthymomatous MG-patients, operated in 2 European Thoracic Surgery Institutions between 1990 and 2015. Explored clinical outcome parameters were (1) remission rate, (2) improvement of Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical status and (3) reduction (<10 mg of prednisone) or suspension of steroids therapy. Crude and Propensity score (PS) adjusted comparisons by type of surgical approach C-US vs RATS/VATS were performed using logistic regression method. Missing data were multiple-imputed and combined estimates were obtained from 5 imputed datasets. Results: Two-hundred and nine patients were available for the final analysis. Median age was 33 years (interquartile range 24-44) and 199 patients were female (72%). Two-hundred and twenty patients (82%) were operated by C-US, 47 (16%) by RATS and 4 (2%) by VATS. MGFA clinical-status improved in 89% (186/209) of the patients, a remission of symptoms (clinical or pharmacological) was observed in 42% (87/209) and 47% (32/68) suspend/reduce steroid treatment. Considered C-US as reference, we did not observe at PS-adjusted models a significant difference in terms of remission rate (RATS/VATS OR: 1.35, 95% CI 0.65-2.77, P=0.418), improvement of MGFA clinical-status (RATS/VATS OR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.18-1.93, P=0.378) and reduction/suspension of steroid treatment (RATS/VATS OR: 1.43, 95% CI 0.45-4.57, P=0.548). Conclusions: Our results indicated that RATS/VATS had same clinical results as C-US. The choice of the optimal surgical approach should be tailored on the base of availability, desired aesthetic results and physicians and patient preferences.

AB  - Objectives: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been increasingly used in the management of thymic epithelial tumours (TETs). However, its oncologic efficacy remains to be proved. The purpose of this study is to compare the oncologic outcomes following thoracoscopic versus open surgery in case-matched groups of patients with early stage thymic tumours from the Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) retrospective database. Methods: Between 1994 and 2012, a total of 1087 patients having surgery for pathological stage I (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group TNM staging proposal) tumours in ChART retrospective database were retrieved for this study. A propensityscore matched analysis was used to compare the long-term outcomes in patients who received VATS or open surgery. Results: Thoracoscopic resection was performed in 271 (24.9%) and open surgery in 816 patients (75.1%). Before propensity-score matching, the VATS group had smaller tumour size (P=0.002), lower grade histology (P=0.034), lower T stage (P<0.001), and less adjuvant radiotherapy (P<0.001). Propensity-score matching by gender, myasthenia gravis, tumour size, histologic classification, pathological T stage, extent of thymectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemo therapy produced 110 patients in each group. After matching, the differences in tumour size, histology type, T stage, and adjuvant therapy were no longer statistically significant. All matched patients had R0 resection. Overall survival (P=0.539), disease-free survival (P=0.773), cumulative incidence of recurrence (P=0.522), and improvement of myasthenia gravis (P=0.589) were similar between the 2 matched groups. In univariable analysis, only adjuvant chemotherapy was a predictor of OS [hazard ratio (HR) 4.527, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.133-18.085] or DFS (HR 3.696, 95% CI 1.186- 11.514). Conclusions: This propensity-score matched study suggests that VATS and open surgery are associated with similar oncologic outcomes for stage I thymic epithelial tumours. Minimally invasive surgery is an acceptable surgical approach for early stage TETs.

AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was in [patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG)] is a [left-sided approach] superior to a [right-sided approach] in terms of [clinical outcome]? Two hundred and fifty-nine papers were found using the reported search. In looking at both procedures, we selected studies with a sizeable number of patients performing or studying both procedures and comparing their outcome. Hence, only 4 studies represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date, country, study type, patient group, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Two studies compared their clinical experience with a right-sided versus a left-sided video assisted thoracoscopic surgery thymectomy approach, while 1 study compared using a bilateral versus a unilateral right-sided approach in patients with non-thymomatous MG. The number of patients studied included 31, 107 and 103 patients, respectively. All 3 studies demonstrated no difference regarding surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and therapeutic effects (the last study compared the 5-year complete stable remission rate). All 3 studies concluded that both approaches are feasible, effective and comparable in operative and long-term results for the treatment of non-thymomatous MG. One anatomical study compared both approaches in 10 cadavers, 5 in each group. They studied the size of the specimen resected and visualization of different anatomic sites via each approach. Visualization was superior using the left-sided approach, while a right-sided approach resulted in slightly higher chances of an incomplete resection. The study concluded that a left-sided approach achieves a better chance of radical thoracoscopic thymectomy due to anatomic considerations. In conclusion, despite 1 cadaveric study suggesting that a left-sided approach may achieve more complete resection, possibly due to anatomical considerations, there are no differences in outcomes with either unilateral approach in terms of complications, hospital stay or long-term symptom relief.

AB  - Objective: Thymectomy via transsternal approach is the accepted standard surgical procedure within the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) cases for many years. In our study, minimally invasive thymectomy technique and its results are presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were diagnosed myasthenia gravis by the neurology clinics and were performed extended thymectomy in our clinic between 2005-2016 are included to our study. Result(s): In our clinic 28 cases, diagnosed with non-thymomatous MG, underwent extended thymectomy; 11 patients were operated via sternotomy and 17 patients were operated via Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). The study group included 19 female and 9 male patients. While the sternotomy group included 5 male and 6 female patients; the VATS group had 4 male and 13 female patients (p=0,212). Whereas the median age for the sternotomy group was 40,82+16,1 years, the median age for the VATS group was 33,7+11,6 (48,05) years (p=0,082). Peroperative mortality was not seen in both groups, yet there was morbidity for 1 patient in each groups (p=0,833). The length of hospitalization in sternotomy group was 6,2+2,2 days and in VATS group it was 2,8+1,2 days. (p=0,019). Conclusion(s): Complete or extended thymectomy within the treatment of non-thymomatous is a safe and an effective method. In the experienced clinics minimally invasive techniques are appropriate choices for the patients upon with the lack of mortality and viable morbidity rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We performed propensity score (PS) models to compare the outcome of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) submitted to 2 different surgical approaches: extended transsternal (T-3b) or thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET). METHODS: Patients' clinical data were retrieved from the MG database of the C. Besta Neurologic Institute Foundation. In the PS analysis, a matching ratio of 1:1 of the main clinical variables was obtained for the 2 groups of patients and treatment effect was estimated by comparing their outcome. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients met the inclusion criteria, by having a complete set of clinical data, and were included in the PS model; a matched dataset of 122 participants (61 per group) showed an adequate balance of all the covariates. Our analysis demonstrated that 68.9% of patients who had thymectomy by the VATET technique reached the pharmacologic remission/remission status at 2 years from thymectomy compared to 34.4% of those operated on by the T-3b technique (p < 0.001), had a lower INCB-MG score (p < 0.001), and had less muscle fatigability (p = 0.004). Similar results were found considering only nonthymomatous patients with MG. Results were also confirmed by paired statistical tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our PS matching analysis showed that VATET is a reliable and effective surgical approach alternative to T-3b in patients with MG who are candidates for thymectomy. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with MG, VATET is more effective than T-3b thymectomy.

AB  - Objective: Thymectomy is considered the standard procedure for treatment of all forms of myasthenia gravis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy is one of the minimally invasive procedures that, because of the short duration of hospitalization and reduced postoperative pain and scarring after a surgical procedure, has replaced the traditional operations for patients with myasthenia gravis, but there are still differences and concerns. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of 2 different surgical techniques: video-assisted thoracoscopic versus a transsternal thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Methods: Forty-two patients with myasthenia gravis and no thymus tumor were evaluated in a pilot programorganized on the basis of the classification system of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America and drug consumption. Then, the patients randomly underwent 2 different surgical techniques: video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy versus transsternal thymectomy Patients were evaluated on the basis of preoperative and postoperative variables. Results: Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were reduced in patients who underwent the video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy technique. Also, the duration of the surgical procedure was reduced significantly in these patients. These patients had less blood loss during the surgical procedure than the TS group. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classification system for VATS thymectomy indicated that the number of persons with complete stable remission postoperatively was higher and the number of persons who remained unchanged was lower. Conclusions: Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy is a safe and appropriate approach versus traditional methods such as transsternal thymectomy for patients with myasthenia gravis. This method has better postoperative results and can be used as an alternative minimally invasive method instead of a transsternal thymectomy.

AB  - Background This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and to compare the oncologic outcomes of VATS with those of sternotomy in patients with thymoma. Methods The clinical outcomes of 2,835 patients with thymic epithelial tumors treated between 1991 and 2010 in 32 Japanese institutions were collected retrospectively. The study compared postoperative complications, positive surgical margins, location of recurrence, and survival in 140 of 142 VATS-treated patients (VATS group) matched with 140 of 1,294 sternotomy-treated patients (ST group) by using propensity scores. Results Postoperative complications were observed in 8 patients in the VATS group. The morbidity rate in the VATS group was not different from that of the ST group (p = 0.25). Positive surgical margins were noted in 4 patients (3 in the VATS group; 1 in the ST group). There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between groups (median follow-up period: 3.7 years in the VATS group; 5.2 years in the ST group). In total the most frequent site of recurrence was pleural dissemination. In the VATS group, the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 93.8%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 97.9%. There was no difference in the recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates between the VATS group and the ST group (p = 0.91 and p = 0.74, respectively). Conclusions VATS thymectomy was feasible and comparable to sternotomy for the treatment of patients with thymoma with regard to morbidity, incomplete resection rate, and prognosis. However, additional follow-up is required to evaluate long-term outcomes. Copyright © 2017 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thymectomy features less operative trauma, improved cosmesis, and similar efficiency compared with transsternal (TS) thymectomy for treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Unilateral VATS thymectomy can be easily performed from either side of the thorax, because thymus is located in the middle of mediastinum. Nevertheless, the side that provides better outcomes remains controversial. This study presents our experience on treatments for MG and reveals the differences between the unilateral VATS thymectomy performed on each side. METHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients with MG who underwent TS or VATS thymectomy on either side between January 2003 and December 2012 were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathologic data and surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed and compared among different surgical approaches. RESULTS: TS thymectomy was administered in 50 patients, whereas unilateral VATS approaches were performed on the remaining 31 patients, 15 on the left side and 16 on the right side. The VATS group exhibited a significantly shorter surgery duration (P<0.001), less intraoperative blood loss (P=0.009), shorter postoperative hospital stay (P=0.025), smaller thoracic drainage volume (P=0.033), shorter thoracic drainage duration (P=0.006), and less postoperative complications (P<0.001) compared with the TS group. However, disease remission rates did not significantly differ among the groups (P=0.988). The left-sided group exhibited considerably longer thoracic drainage duration than the right-sided group (P=0.041). Moreover, surgical time (P=0.736), intraoperative blood loss (P=0.281), postoperative hospital stay (P=0.599), thoracic drainage volume (P=0.571), postoperative complications (P=0.742) and therapeutic effect (P=1.000) did not significantly differ among the groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that the ocular type of MG is the only independent factor for clinical remission (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral VATS thymectomy can reduce surgical risks and shorten hospitalization duration without threatening the therapeutic effect. This technique can be safely and effectively performed by experienced surgeons in either side of the thorax.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is so far not clear that how myasthenia gravis (MG) affected the prognosis of thymoma patients. The aim of this assay is to compare the postoperative survival between patients with thymoma only and those with both thymoma and MG. METHODS: The Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) registry recruited patients with thymoma from 18 centers over the country on an intention to treat basis from 1992 to 2012. Two groups were formed according to whether the patient complicated MG. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed, Patients were followed and their survival status were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 1,850 patients included in this study, including 421 with and 1,429 without MG. Complete thymectomy were done in 91.2% patients in MG group and 71.0% in non-MG group (P<0.05). There were more percentage of patients with the histology of thymoma AB, B1, or B2 (P<0.05) in MG group, and more percentage of patients with MG were in Masaoka stage I and II. The 5 year and 10 year OS rates were both higher in MG group (93% vs 88%; 83% vs 81%, P=0.034) respectively. The survival rate was significantly higher in patients with MG when the Masaoka staging was III/IV (P=0.003). Among patients with advanced stage thymoma (stage III, IVa, IVb), the constituent ratios of III, IVa, IVb were similar between MG and Non-MG group. Histologically, however, there were significantly more proportion of AB/B1/B2/B3 in the MG group while there were more C in the non-MG group (P=0.000). Univariate analyses for all patients showed that MG, WHO classification, Masaoka stage, surgical approach, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and resectability were significant factors, and multivariate analysis showed WHO Classification, Masaoka stage, and resectability were strong independent prognostic indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Although MG is not an independent prognostic factor, the survival of patients with thymoma was superior when MG was present, especially in late Masaoka stage patients. Possible reasons included early diagnosis of the tumor, better histologic types, an overall higher R0 resection and less recurrence..

AB  - Aims: Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly used for thymectomy. The most recent development in robotic thoracoscopic surgery has been successfully applied for mediastinal pathologies. The aim of this study is to compare thoracoscopic and robotic approaches in thymectomy for nontumoral myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: In a retrospective match-pair study, the results of 34 thoracoscopic thymectomies (January 2008 to December 2013) were compared with the results of 34 robotic thoracoscopic thymectomies (January 2008 to December 2013). All of the patients were operated on by the same surgeon and apart from the docking and un-docking of robotic platform all operative times were the same. Data from both series were collected prospectively. All patients were matched-paired with respect to age, gender, type of myasthenia gravis, comorbidities and length of follow-up. Results: Inpatient length of stay was 6.18 days for thoracoscopic approach and 4.88 days for robotic approach, but with no statistical significance (p = 0.452). The preoperative and postoperative MGFA QMG scores were equivalent between the two groups. Complete stable remission rate (CSR) at 1 years was 29 % in thoracoscopic groups and 50 % in robotic group with p<0.05. At 5 year after thymectomy CSR was 60 % in patients with thoracoscopic approach and 65 % in patients with robotic approach. The postoperative use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs in patients with robotic approach was lower than that of the patients with thoracoscopic approach, 13.06 mg/day and 32.65 mg/day respectively, with p = 0.030<0.05. The same pattern was also seen with respect to the use of corticotherapy drugs, 3.29 mg/day in patients with robotic approach compared with 5.94 mg/day in patients with thoracoscopic approach, and p = 0.017<0.05. Conclusions: Although we have expected to be no differences between the two groups, there is an improved outcome for myasthenia gravis after robotic thymectomy compared with thoracoscopic thymectomy despite the similar techniques. Randomized trials with long-term follow-up will be needed to clearly define the appropriate role of robotic surgery in thymectomy for nontumoral MG.

AB  - Objectives: The treatment of choice for myasthenic patients with thymoma is extended thymectomy while the optimal therapy for non-myasthenic is matter of debate. The aim of the study is to evaluate if thymomectomy is appropriate for "selected" non-myasthenic patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the management and clinical outcome of 123 completely resected patients, 105 with total/extended thymectomy (43 myasthenic) and 18 with thymomectomy over a 20-year period. Comparative analyses to identify differences were performed using the /2 test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous variables. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: No significant differences in age, gender, histology, tumour size, stage, adjuvant therapy and, complications were observed. A significant higher percentage of patients in thymomectomy group complained with thoracic symptoms. In total/extended thymectomy group 103 patients had a median sternotomy while two had a combined approach. R-0 thymomectomy was performed through thoracotomy in 12 cases (66%), thoracoscopy in 4 (22%), cervicotomy in 1 (6%) and clamshell incision in 1 case (6%). No postoperative mortality was recorded. Complications were 23 (22%) in total/extended thymectomy group (12 arrhythmia, five respiratory failure, three bleeding, two osteomyelitis, one lymphorrhea) and two (11%) in thymomectomy group (pericardial effusion, respiratory failure). At a median follow-up of 64 months (range 3-236) in total/extended thymectomy group 8 patients developed postoperative myasthenia gravis, eight patients had recurrence and three of them died for thymoma. We did not observe any case of postoperative myasthenia gravis or recurrence in thymomectomy group. No case ofmultiple thymoma occurred in both groups. Conclusion: In "selected" non-myasthenic thymoma patients, R-0 thymomectomy seems to have the same oncological outcome than total/extended thymectomy without increased risk of developing postoperative myasthenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported on single-port thymectomy (SPT), which involves performing thymectomy via a single subxiphoid incision, and trans-subxiphoid robotic thymectomy (TRT), which is performed using the da Vinci surgical system. The aim of this study was to investigate the early surgical outcomes of thymectomy using the SPT and TRT subxiphoid approaches and to discuss their appropriate uses. METHODS: The subjects included 80 patients who underwent thymectomy via a subxiphoid approach. These patients were selected from among 99 surgical cases of myasthenia gravis or anterior mediastinal tumors at Fujita Health University Hospital between March 2011 and November 2015. The patients were divided into a SPT group (n=72) and a TRT group (n=8). RESULTS: The operative time was shorter in the SPT group compared with that in the TRT group (135+/-48 and 20+/-40 min, respectively; P=0.0004). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of blood loss volume (5.9+/-16.8 and 5.4+/-4.6 mL, respectively; P=0.48), postoperative hospital stay duration (4.0+/-2.0 and 4.3+/-3.6 days, respectively; P=0.21), or the period of postoperative oral analgesic use (10.7+/-5.4 and 10.1+/-3.4 days, respectively; P=0.89). There were no intraoperative complications, such as intraoperative bleeding, in either group. In the SPT group, there was one case (1.4%) of postoperative left phrenic nerve paralysis and one case (1.4%) of transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. No one died during or after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: TRT may be as equally minimally invasive as SPT. In cases where the thymoma has infiltrated the surrounding organs, the extent of the infiltration should be used to determine whether to select TRT, or median sternotomy.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Thymectomy involves the removal of all the soft tissue in the pre-vascular plane of the anterior mediastinum between the two phrenic nerves. Surgical success in controlling myasthenia and the most important factor influencing survival in patients with thymoma depends on complete clearance of thymic tissue. Currently there is a perception that the open (median sternotomy) approach offers better visualisation of the thymic tissue. This perceived advantage is thought to justify the invasive nature of the procedure associated with increased morbidity. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for thymectomy has evolved significantly over the last decade, including bilateral and unilateral VATS (either left or right) approaches. The laterality of the approach remains largely on surgeon preferences, with the decision influenced by their experience and training. VATS offers superior illumination and magnification, particularly with the availability of advanced cameras with variable angles that provide better exposure and lighting of the operative field. The use of three-dimensional-operating imaging has also revolutionised the VATS technique. VATS thymectomy is a superior and radical technique in minimising access trauma and removing all thymic tissue that may be scattered in the anterior mediastinum and cervical fat. Other advantages of VATS include less intraoperative blood loss, early removal of chest drains, less requirement for blood products, decreased inflammatory cytokine response, shorter hospital stay and superior cosmesis. There is also a decreased risk of respiratory and cardiac related complications compared to the open (sternotomy) technique. Furthermore, no significant difference has been found in long-term complications and survival rate between VATS and open approaches. Subsequently, the VATS approach should be encouraged as more surgeons are adopting the minimally invasive practice as routine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy has become a feasible treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG) in recent years. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the perioperative characteristics, safety, and completely stable remission rate in patients with MG who received VATS or open thymectomy (OT). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and CNKI for related articles using combinations of the search terms video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy, transsternal thymectomy, and MG. The inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by chi<sup>2</sup>-based Q statistics, and the extent of inconsistency was generated by I<sup>2</sup> statistics. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 1173 patients were included, and there was no difference in the operation time (p = 0.08) and ICU time (p = 0.14) between the two groups, but VATS thymectomy was associated with less intra-operation blood loss and hospital time (p < 0.00001). VATS was also associated with lower rates of total complication (OR =0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.94; p = 0.03) and myasthenic crisis (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; p = 0.03), but the rates of pneumonia (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29-1.32; p = 0.21) and complete remission rate (CSR) (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.38-1.09; p = 0.10) had no obvious differences between the VATS and OT groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with MG undergoing VATS thymectomy achieved better surgical outcomes and fewer complications than those who received OT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thymectomy may be part of the therapeutic strategy in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) without thymoma. Median sternotomy is still considered as the gold standard, but during the last 15 years, several groups have demonstrated the non-inferiority of cervicotomy with upper sternotomy and minimally invasive techniques. To date, there is no consensus on surgical procedure choice. The aim of our study was to compare the morbidity and mortality of three techniques [cervicotomy with upper sternotomy versus sternotomy versus video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)/robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS)] from the national database EPITHOR and to analyse French epidemiology. METHODS: From the national thoracic surgery database EPITHOR, we have extracted all the details regarding thymectomies performed for non-thymomatous MG. We have divided thymectomy into three groups: A-sternotomy; B-cervicotomy with upper sternotomy; C-VATS/RATS. We investigated the postoperative morbidity and mortality without analysis of the long-term evolution of the disease not available on EPITHOR. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2013, 278 patients were included: 131 (47%) in Group A, 31 (11%) in Group B and 116 (42%) in Group C. The sex ratio F/M was 2.3. The mean age was, respectively, 42 +/- 17, 42 +/- 16, 35 +/- 14 years old (P < 0.01). The number of patients without comorbidities was 63 (48%), 25 (81%) and 78 (65%), respectively (P < 0.01). The operative time was 94 +/- 37, 79 +/- 42 and 112 +/- 59 min, respectively (P < 0.01). The number of patients who presented at least one postoperative complication was 12 (14%), 0 and 3 (9%) (P= 0.03), respectively. The postoperative lengths of stay were 7.7 +/- 4.5, 5 +/- 1.7 and 4.5 +/- 2 days, respectively (P < 0.01). There was no death. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we were unable to prove the superiority of minimally invasive techniques due to the important differences between the groups. However, this study shows us major changes in French surgical procedures during the last decade with an increase in minimally invasive procedures such as VATS and RATS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients with a history of myasthenic crisis (MC) has not been well established. Here, we determined the efficacy of thymectomy by assessing the long-term clinical outcomes and reviewed thymectomy reports on MC patients. METHODS: Subjects included 31 patients who suffered at least one crisis before surgery, with a cumulative total 73 episodes of MC in Southern China between May 2000 and December 2010. Long-term follow-up was performed and clinical outcomes were evaluated. We used complete stable remission (CSR), termed an asymptomatic status without medication for at least 12 months; general complete remission (GCR), termed an asymptomatic status with or without some form of therapy excluding cholinesterase inhibitors, to assess patient outcomes. RESULTS: All patients underwent thymectomy with an overall complication rate of 16.1 % and a perioperative mortality rate of 3.2 %. Long-term follow-up occurred between 12.6 and 177 months, at which point 18 (58.1 %) patients experienced improved status, including one patient who achieved CSR; 13 (41.9 %) patients achieved GCR; 6 (19.4 %) showed unchanged status and one worse (3.2 %) status. The remaining 6 patients died, with 3 due to MG-related causes. Using a multivariate Cox regression analysis of GCR by characteristics, patients with better response to medical treatments before thymectomy were positively associated with GCR rates (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Extended transsternal thymectomy is a feasible and effective therapy for MG patients with crisis history, especially for those patients who have shown positive signs of remission after exhausting conventional medical treatments.

AB  - The efficacy of thymectomy and the optimal surgical technique in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) remain controversial. Long-term outcomes are lacking and remission rates are based on small populations. We reviewed our institutional experience of thymectomy for MG focusing on long-term outcomes, complete stable remission (CSR), improvement of symptoms, after transcervical, transsternal, thoracotomy, and VATS thymectomy. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of 3017 patients from 1941-2013 with MG was performed. Patients who underwent thymectomy with follow-up data including age at the time of surgery, sex, date of onset of symptoms, date of surgery, Osserman classification before and after surgery, surgical technique, date of remission, and status at last follow-up were included in the analysis. CSR and prognostic factors were analyzed by crude rate, Kaplan-Meier estimate, chi-squared test, Wilcoxon test, and a Cox proportional model. Overall, 1002 thymectomy patients with complete data were analyzed, and 35.5% (n = 355) derived benefit from surgery. Crude rate CSR was 19% (n = 191) and an additional 16% (n = 164) symptomatically improved requiring less medication after thymectomy. Also, 58% (n = 580) were stable after resection, and 6.7% (n = 67) developed progressive disease. Kaplan-Meier estimates of CSR were 27.7%, 36.7%, and 47.3% at 10, 25, and 40 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, transsternal technique, thymoma, and preoperative Osserman classification were significantly associated with failure to achieve CSR. Thymectomy provides long-term CSR in 47.3% of patients with long-term follow-up. Patients with MG should be offered thymectomy when possible.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to compare thymectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and trans-sternal thymectomy (TS) for myasthenia gravis patients. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted to compare thoracoscopic surgery and sternotomy for myasthenia gravis patients with regard to long-term effect and short-term safety. RESULTS: A total of 23 trials were included in our research. No significant differences were detected with regard to myasthenic crisis, wound infection, and muscle weakness improvement. VATS led to less blood loss than TS (standardized mean difference, -1.233; 95% confidence interval, -1.425--1.041; P < 0.001), less risk of pulmonary infection (relative risk, 1.035; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.070; P = 0.043), and a shorter hospital stay. TS had a shorter operative time than VATS (standardized mean difference, 0.239; 95% confidence interval, 0.113-0.365; P < 0.001). VATS and TS achieved similar mean specimen weights and complete stable remission rates. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies, VATS increases surgical safety and achieves an equal surgical efficacy to TS, but TS has a shorter operative time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete open surgical resection is the standard treatment for thymoma and myasthenia gravis. We evaluated the feasibility of bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy, and compared it to surgery via sternotomy. METHODS: From 2011 to 2014, 43 patients undergoing thymectomy were divided into 2 groups: 23 underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy, and 20 had thymectomy via sternotomy. The primary outcomes were postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 1-month postoperatively, and morphine consumption in the first 48 h. Secondary outcomes were surgical and clinical results. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of demographics and preoperative clinical data. Compared to the sternotomy group, the video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy group had lower pain scores and morphine consumption at all time points, significantly less operative blood loss and chest drainage volume, and shorter hospital stay. The rates of improvement in myasthenia gravis were 85% and 86% in the video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy and sternotomy groups, respectively. No recurrence of thymoma was found in either group (median follow-up 27 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our results seem to confirm that in selected cases, video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy allows complete resection of thymus and perithymic tissue, similar to sternotomy but with the known advantages of minimally invasive surgery including less pain and a good cosmetic result.

AB  - Background: Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by the production of abnormal autoantibodies directed against the receptors present in the neuromuscular junction. It has been the practice to offer thymectomy in all generalized Myasthenia gravis patients despite the uncertainty regarding its benefits. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to describe the clinical profile and differentiate the clinical outcomes of thymectomy versus non-thymectomy, and thymomatous versus non-thymomatous Myasthenia Gravis patients in the Philippine General Hospital. Methodology: Between 2009 and 2014, a total of 69 post-thymectomy and 16 nonthymectomy patient records were successfully retrieved. The demographic characteristics, surgical approach and histopathologic results were obtained. The clinical outcome after six months or one year follow-up was also determined and grouped according to the following: 1) complete remission, 2) pharmacological remission, 3) no clinical change 4) worsening symptoms and 5) mortality. The data were encoded and analysed using the Epi-Info 7.0 program. Results: Majority of patients were females (68.0[percnt]) with a mean age of 39.8 years (Range: 18-69 years) and a mean duration of myasthenic symptoms of 21 months. Using the MGFA classification, 54.1[percnt] of patients fell under Class II and 48.2[percnt] of them presented with generalized weakness. In this study, 60.8[percnt] of post-thymectomy Myasthenia gravis patients had either complete remission or pharmacologic remission compared to 12.5[percnt] among nonthymectomy patients (p-value <0.001). No significant difference in the clinical outcome was found between thymomatous and non-thymomatous Myasthenia gravis after thymectomy (p-value 0.29). Conclusion: This study showed that both thymomatous and non-thymomatous Myasthenia gravis patients who underwent thymectomy had a higher incidence of complete stable remission and pharmacologic remission as compared to Myasthenia gravis patients who did not undergo thymectomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Does extended transsternal thymectomy (ETTX) combined with a defined prednisone protocol, compared with the prednisone protocol alone: result in a greater improvement in myasthenic weakness; result in a lower total dose of prednisone; and enhance the quality of life by reduction of adverse events? BACKGROUND Since first utilized in 1941, a benefit from thymectomy in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) has been claimed by numerous studies. In 2000, an evidence-based review summarized outcomes from 21 controlled, non-randomized MG cohorts, pointed out methodological flaws preventing definite conclusions regarding the procedure's benefit and concluded that thymectomy should be a treatment option. In concert with calls dating back a half century, the reviewers recommended a controlled, randomized study that employed a standardized medical therapy. METHODS MGTX was organized as a five-continent, international, single-blinded, randomized trial with the aim to answer three questions posed above. Inclusion criteria were MG Foundation of America Clinical Classification 2 to 4, elevated acetylcholine receptor antibody levels, age >18.0 and <65.0 years, and disease history <5 years. Patients were followed in single-blind fashion for a minimum of 3 years. RESULTS A total of 126 patients were enrolled between 2006 and 2012 across 36 sites. The mean age was 35.1 years. MGFA Class at the time of randomization: 39.7[percnt] were class IIa, 25[percnt] Class IIb, 22[percnt] Class IIIa, 10.3[percnt] Class IIIb, and 2[percnt] Class IVa and Class IVb combined. Sixty percent were diagnosed within a year of onset. CONCLUSIONS A result favoring thymectomy would establish its benefits unequivocally; failure to show a difference would suggest that thymectomy is an unnecessary procedure in this non-thymomatous population and should lead to cost savings. Thus the results will impact on clinical practice. The last patient out will occur in November 2015 and final results of the practice changing trial will be presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for thymic disorders has been introduced, its oncological outcome and benefits over others open approaches remains unclear. Single-port VATS thymectomy using a flexible port and CO<sub>2</sub> has been described. However, VATS thymectomy is possible by a single incision of 3 cm without CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation or special port device avoiding objections related to CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation and allowing instruments to move more freely making procedure easier and cheaper. Our institutional experience in open and CO<sub>2</sub>-less VATS single-port thymectomy was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate compared to sternotomy, the clinical and oncological outcomes with this novel approach. METHODS: A retrospective review consisting of 84 patients who underwent thymectomy because different thymic disorders especially thymoma was performed. Eighteen patients underwent CO<sub>2</sub>-less VATS single port thymectomy, while 66 underwent thymectomy through open sternotomy. Many clinical factors associated with the surgical and clinical outcomes, including tumor recurrence and clinical remission, were recorded. RESULTS: Non major postoperative complications were observed in any group. The median operative time and postoperative hospital stay of CO<sub>2</sub>-less VATS single port thymectomy were 95 min and 1 day, respectively and 120 min and 7 days for open sternotomy. The thymoma was the most common thymic disorder with 7 patients (38%) in VATS group and 28 patients (42.4%) for the open approach. The median lesion size was 2.6 cm in the VATS group and 3.2 cm in the open approach. No thymoma recurrence in patients undergoing VATS was observed during the follow-up time, while in the open surgery group 14.28% recurrence was observed, distributed as follows: loco-regional 75% and 25% at distance; free disease period of these patients was 8.3 months. Thymectomy associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) was observed in 6 (33%) patients in the VATS group and 32 (48%) patients for sternotomy; our results regarding thymectomy for the treatment of MG were established by the MG post-intervention status [complete stable remission (CSR), pharmacologic remission, minimal manifestations, improved, unchanged and worse exacerbation, and died of MG] and reflected similar results in both approaches. CONCLUSIONS: CO<sub>2</sub>-less VATS single-port thymectomy is a feasible and safe procedure. Oncologic outcomes are similar to open approaches. Complications, surgical time and hospital stay are shorter compared with sternotomy. This is an initial experience, further work is required to evaluate long-term results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the different pathological and clinical characteristics of thymomas with and without myasthenia gravis (MG) and to determine whether the presence of MG influences the prognosis in thymoma patients. METHODS: The clinical data from 228 consecutive patients (median sternotomy were used in 153, video-assisted thoracoscopic themectomy were used in 75) operated on from January 1992 to December 2007 was analyzed retrospectively. These thymoma patients had been subdivided into two groups: thymoma with MG (n = 125) and thymoma without MG (n = 103). All thymic epithelial tumors were classified according to the WHO histologic classification and the Masaoka clinical staging system. The result was evaluated according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America's criterion. The clinical features of the 2 test was compared between the two groups by chi2 test, and the survival were compared between the two groups by Cox analysis. RESULTS: There were no peri-operative deaths. 19 cases were inoperable (6 in the group with MG, 13 without MG (chi2 = 4.52, P = 0.035)). The proportions of type A and thymic carcinoma were 0 in the group with MG, 10.5% (11/103) and 11.6% (12/103) respectively in the group without MG. According to the Masaoka's clinical staging, in the group MG, 24.8% (31/125) patients were stage III and IV; in the group without MG, 33.0% (34/103) patients were stage III and IV. There was a significant difference between hyperplastic paraneoplastic thymus coexisting in 28.8% (36/125) patients with MG and only 5.8% (6/103) in patients without MG (chi2 = 20.91, P = 0.000) Microthymoma was identified in the paraneoplastic thymus of 3 patients with MG. There were 198 patients followed up, the rate was 86.8% (198/228). There was no recurrence in patients with type A and a few patients with type AB, B1, B2, B3 thymoma and thymic carcinoma recurred. The actuarial 5- and 10-year survival rates were 89.3% and 81.2% for patients with MG respectively, and 90.0% and 78.9% for patients without MG respectively. Within 5 years postoperatively, 6 of 9 patients with MG died of myasthenia crisis, while 6 out of 7 deaths in patients without MG were attributable to inoperable tumors (stage IV) and thymic carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of myasthenia gravis has little influence on the prognosis of thymomas, but it is good for early diagnosis and treatment. Extended thymectomy should be performed to all patients with thymoma, no matter they have myasthenia gravis or not. The main cause of death is myasthenia crisis for thymoma patients with MG and stage IV and (or) thymic carcinoma for patients without MG.

AB  - Background and aims: The aim of the study was to determine the clinical and pathological characteristics of thymoma- associated myasthenia gravis (T-MG) patients and to evaluate the independent predictors of clinical outcomes (gender, age of onset, first symptom, MG clinical stage, tumor staging) Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among 26 T-MG patients (7.02% of our total MG patients) who underwent thymectomy in our department over a 22-year period (1990-2012). The surgical approach was sternotomy or anterolateral thoracotomy Results: Median age was 43.70+/-9.88 years. Ocular onset MG was recorded in 72.3% of patients. Before thymomectomy, disease severity was graded as mild generalized (I, IIa/b), moderate generalized (IIIa/b, severe generalized (IVa/b) in 32%, 31.98%, 29.% 7.02%, respectively. After surgery 16.7% of patients achieved complete stable remission while 83.3% of them were classified as in pharmacological remission. During follow-up, 50% of patients had a clinical relapse and 12% of patients had a thymoma relapse. Neither clinical nor pathological variables (tumor stage, tumor invasion) were correlated with the chance of achieving complete stable remission (CSR). However CSR was never recorded in bulbar onset MG patients. Immunosuppressive drugs were required for controlling the symptoms Conclusion: TG may have a worse prognosis than MG without thymoma. As no clinical and pathological predictors for outcome were identified, T-MG patients must be followed carefully for a clinical relapse and tumor recurrence. Long-term immunosuppressive drugs are also required.

AB  - Background: To investigate the safety and feasibility of the subxiphoid and subcostal approach in video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) extended thymectomy for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: Clinical data of 45 eligible patients who underwent VATS extended thymectomy for MG in our department from April 2014 to June 2015 by the same surgical team were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty five through right chest cases (group A), placed in the 30degree left lateral decubitus position, were made three 5 to 10 mm incisions on the right chest. The en bloc dissection of thymus and perithymic and pericardiophrenic fatty tissue was achieved under the condition of general anesthesia with trachea double catheter insertion and one-lung ventilation. Twenty subxiphoid and subcostal cases (group B), placed in the type supine position, were made a 15 mm subxiphoid thoracoscope incision and two 5 mm operation incisions at the intersection point of bilateral midclavicular line and subcostal margin and resected the thymus and adipose tissue in the middle of bilateral phrenic nerve under the condition of general anesthesia, with trachea single catheter insertion and artificial pneumothorax. Retrospective analysis the clinical data of the two groups. Results: All the surgeries were finished successfully without conversion to open thoracotomy. There were no significant differences between the two groups in operation time and the length of postoperative hospital stay [operation time: group A (139.5+/-39.7) min, group B (136.1+/-51.7) min; postoperative hospital stay: group A (10.2+/-17.5) d, group B (3.8+/-1.1) d; P>0.05]. The amount of blood loss and thoracic drainage periods in group B were less than group A [amount of blood loss: group A (138.8+/-123.0) mL, group B (66.5+/-42.8) mL; thoracic drainage periods: group A (1.7+/-1.0) d, group B (1.0+/-0.4) d; P<0.05]. Conclusions: This procedure offers the advantage of good surgical access for dissection around the bilateral phrenic nerves in extended thymectomy. It is more easily for surgeons to fully reveal the left phrenic nerve and the upper thymic poles.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compared with conventional median sternotomy, approaches used in thymectomy for myasthenia gravis and anterior mediastinal tumours have become much less invasive in recent years. We previously developed a surgical technique called single-port thymectomy (SPT) to excise the thymus through a single opening made below the xiphoid process. In this study, to show the utility of SPT, we compared factors contributing to low surgical invasiveness between SPT and conventional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2014, 146 patients underwent surgery for anterior mediastinal tumour or myasthenia gravis at our hospital. After excluding patients diagnosed with tumour invasion of nearby organs or those who had undergone concurrent removal of nearby organs, 81 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study as subjects. Patients were divided into the VATS thymectomy group (VATS group, n = 35) and the SPT group (n = 46). Surgical duration, blood loss, duration of hospital stay and the amount and duration of postoperative oral analgesics were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Operating time did not vary significantly between the VATS and SPT groups (P = 0.0853). The amount of blood loss was higher in the VATS group than in the SPT group (P < 0.0001). The duration of hospital stay was longer in the VATS group than in the SPT group (P = 0.0008). The amount of postoperative oral analgesics was significantly higher in the VATS group than in the SPT group (P = 0.0092). Similarly, the duration of postoperative oral analgesics was significantly longer in the VATS group than in the SPT group (P = 0.0312). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with VATS thymectomy, SPT required a similar operating time, was associated with less blood loss and enabled postoperative analgesics to be discontinued earlier. Therefore, it could be considered a less invasive surgical approach. Copyright © The Author 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of minimally invasive thymectomy (MIT) is increasing and may have significant benefit to patients in terms of morbidity and post-operative recovery. Our aim was to review the Mayo Clinic experience of MIT. METHODS: We reviewed data from all MIT cases collected in a prospectively maintained database from January 1995 to February 2015. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, perioperative management and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 510 thymectomies were performed in 20 years. Fifty-six patients underwent MIT (45 video-assisted thoracoscopy, 11 robotic-assisted). The median age was 55 years (range, 23-87 years) with male to female ratio of 25:31. Thymoma was the main pathologic diagnosis in 27/56 patients (48%), with 11/27 (41%) associated with myasthenia gravis (MG), and 16/27 (59%) non-MG. Other pathologies included 1/56 (2%) of each teratoma, lymphoma, lymphangioma, carcinoma and thymolipoma. There were 3/56 (5%) atrophic glands, 4/56 (7%) cysts, 6/56 (11%) benign glands and 11/56 (20%) hyperplastic. Mean blood loss (mL) and operative time (min) were significantly lower in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) group compared to robotic (65+/-41 vs. 160+/-205 mL, P=0.04 and 102+/-39 vs. 178+/-53 min, P=0.001, respectively). There was no 30-day mortality. Post-operative morbidity occurred in 7/45 (16%) VATS patients (phrenic nerve palsy 7%, pericarditis 4%, atrial fibrillation 2%, pleural effusion 2%) and 1/11 (9%) robotic (urinary retention requiring self-catheterization). Reoperation was required in 1/3 of VATS patients with phrenic nerve palsy. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay [VATS 1.5 days (range, 1-4 days) and robotic 2 days (range, 1-5 days) VATS; P=0.05]. Mean follow-up was 18.4 months (range, 1-50.4 months) with no tumor recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: MIT can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. VATS is associated with reduced blood loss, operative times and earlier hospital discharge compared to robotic MIT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Different methods of open or minimally invasive thymectomies have been recommended for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). We compared the results of standard transsternal thymectomy (TS) and two different types of minimally invasive thymectomies [video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) and classic Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (cVATS)] performed at the same department. METHODS: During three different time periods 71 patients (60 female and 11 male; mean age 31 [range, 14-84] years) underwent thymectomy for MG. Twenty-three underwent standard transsternal thymectomy (January 1995 - September 2004), 22 VATET (September 2004 - August 2009), and 26 cVATS (September 2009 - December 2011) thymectomy for the right side. Operative data, MG- and surgery-related postoperative morbidity and early improvement of MG during the initial 1-year follow-up period were compared among the three methods. RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths during the study period. Operative time was 112, 211, and 116 minutes (p = 0.001) in the TS, VATET and cVATS, respectively, and the length of hospital stay was 8.9, 5.6, and 4.0 (p = 0.001) days. Postoperative MG-related neurological morbidity affected 21.7%, 18.2%, and 7.7% (p = 0.365) of the patients and the surgery-related morbidity rate was 4.3%, 13.7%, and 0% (p = 0.118) in the TS, VATET and cVATS groups, respectively. Symptom improvement rates were 91.3%, 94.7%, and 87.5% (p = 0.712), and complete remission rates were 13%, 10.5%, and 11.5% (p = 0.917) after TS, VATET and cVATS thymectomies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of operative time and hospital stay the best results were found after cVATS. The use of a less invasive surgical intervention resulted in less surgical-, and MG related neurological complications. The improvement of MG symptoms was excellent and results were similar after different types of thymectomies.

AB  - Background Complete surgical excision is the most important long-term prognostic factor of thymomas. Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been reported as an effective treatment to excise mediastinal thymic lesions, it has not replaced median sternotomy as the standard approach because of the lack of long-term follow-up studies. The objective of this study was to analyze and to compare the outcome of VATS extended thymectomy with the traditional open approach. Methods This is a single center's retrospective study of 27 patients submitted to surgery for early stage thymomas between 1995 and 2007. Histologic subtype and clinicopathologic staging were classified, respectively, according to World Health Organization and Masaoka criteria. Patients with preoperative computed tomography scan evidence of clinical Masaoka stage 1 thymomas were selected for VATS thymectomy with unilateral technique. Results All patients successfully underwent surgery: 3 with VATS and 4 with an open approach. There were no differences in time of surgery and postoperative complication between the two groups. Patients who had VATS had shorter postoperative hospital stay than patients who had open technique. After a median follow-up of 123 months, there were no postoperative recurrences. Conclusion VATS is a safe operation and has comparable effectiveness to the open technique in terms of oncological radicality for small, early stage thymoma.

AB  - Background: To compare the safety and effectiveness of a novel 3-hole surgical method using an approach through the subxiphoid with VATS in treating myasthenia gravis. Methods: From January 2013 to August 2014, 70 cases of myasthenia gravis were selected, 34 of which were operated on using the novel 3-hole surgical method extended thymectomy approach and 36 using VATS from the right side of the chest. The novel 3-hole surgical method procedure was as follows: (I) with the patient in a supine position and legs apart at 45degree-60degree, one 2.0-cm incision and two 0.5-cm surgery holes were made subxiphoid and the bilateral rib arch; (II) the retrosternal space was exposed using both blunt and sharp dissection. The thymus, the bilateral mediastinal pleurae and its surrounding fat tissues were completely removed; (III) at the end of the surgery, drainage was not necessary after draw off all mediastinum CO<inf>2</inf>. The observed indices were operation time, bleeding volume, length of postoperative hospital stay, occurrence of pain, sternotomy conversion ratio and its reasons, mortality rate from complications. Results: (I) The mean surgery time in the 3-hole group was significantly less than that of the VATS group (90.3+/-21.1 vs. 120+/-24.6 min, P<0.01), and the volume of bleeding in the 3-hold group was less than that in the VATS group (20.3+/-8.9 vs. 55.1+/-10.4 mL, P<0.05); (II) among those in the 3-hole group, sternotomy was performed on two cases (5.8% of the total cases) because of the close adhesion of lesions with the left vein. Among those in the VATS group, thoracotomy was performed on four cases (11.1%) because of the close adhesion of lesions with the left innominate vein (5.5%, two cases) and hemorrhage caused by injury to the left innominate vein (5.5%, two cases). There were no differences observed between the two groups (5.8% vs. 11.11%, P=0.435); (III) using the Visual Analog Pain Scale, postoperative pain was assessed as being much lower in the 3-hole group than in the VATS group (3.2+/-0.8 vs. 4.5+/-1.5, P<0.01); (IV) the length of postoperative hospital stay in the 3-hole group was also less than that of the VATS group (2.3+/-1.1 vs. 7.4+/-2.3 d, P<0.05); (V) in both groups, the complication and mortality rates were 0%. Conclusions: Our innovative 3-hole surgical method is markedly better than VATS in extended thymus resection in the following ways: (I) less possibility of injuring any vessels during surgery; (II) the surgery time and bleeding volume were also significantly reduced; (III) postoperative pain was significantly reduced; (IV) postoperative drainage was not necessary; (V) postoperative complications and length of stay were also significantly decreased; (VI) bilateral mediastinal pleurae and adipose tissues could be completely removed and the remission rate of myasthenia gravis greatly improved. This is a good surgical treatment for myasthenia gravis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) is commonly performed bilaterally to remove all the thymic tissue in the mediastinum for the surgical treatment of myasthenia gravis. We hypothesize that the therapeutic efficacy of unilateral thoracoscopic thymectomy (right-sided) is comparable to that of bilateral VATET. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 103 consecutive patients who received VATET for non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (NTMG), with a minimum follow-up period of 36 months. RESULTS: Bilateral VATET was performed in the first 31 patients and right-sided VATET in the following 72. No patients died perioperatively. The operating time in the right-sided VATET group was significantly shorter than that in the bilateral VATET group (169.3 +/- 19.3 vs 152.6 +/- 20.7 min, P<0.001). There were no significant differences between groups, in terms of blood loss, pain severity, drainage time, ICU stay, hospital stay and postoperative morbidity. The median follow-up was 5.2 years. Forty-eight patients achieved complete stable remission (CSR). The 5-year CSR rate, calculated by Life-table analysis, was 52% in the bilateral VATET group and 47% in the right-sided VATET group. These two operative methods did not differ significantly with respect to CSR by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis identified shorter disease duration (<12 months) (P = 0.021, HR = 0.50) and thymic hyperplasia (P = 0.038, HR = 0.48) as independent predictors of higher CSR rates in patients who underwent thymectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcome of right-sided VATET in the surgical treatment of NTMG, in terms of CSR, is comparable to that of bilateral VATET.

AB  - Background and aims: Thymectomy may benefit patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Although transsternal thymectomy is a widespread, traditional surgical technique, videoscopic thymectomy recently became popular with its minimally invasive and superior cosmetic advantages. So far, little is known about short-term and long-term outcomes according to surgical methods. Methods: 236 patients who underwent thymectomy were analyzed retrospectively. 90 patients received transsternal thymectomy and 146 patients were operated on videoscopic thymectomy. We collected data about preoperative demographics, operative, and post-operative factors which may influence short or long-term outcomes. Results: The length of operation time, intubation time, chest tube duration, ICU stay, and hospital stay were significantly shorter in videoscopic thymectomy. Also, lower amount of blood loss during operation and amount of chest tube drainage in videoscopic group were confirmed by our data. Postoperative vital capacity was higher, rate of MG crisis after thymectomy was lower in videoscopic thymectomy. In our data, group of transsternal thymectomy had longer follow up duration. (5.05+/-2.32 year; transsternal VS. 3.30+/-1.74 year; videoscopic) At the last clinical review, 70% (63/90, transsternal) and 43.8% (63/146, videoscopic) had achieved complete stable remission or pharmacological remission. Conclusion: Videoscopic thymectomy demonstrated safe, excellent prognosis regarding operative, short-term outcome variables. Although long-term outcome of videoscopic thymectomy might be inferior to transsternal thymectomy in our data, the shorter follow up duration of this group might influence to remission rate.

AB  - PURPOSE: The use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in patients with thymoma remains controversial. We sought to evaluate the perioperative and oncological outcomes after VATS resection for stage I and II thymoma and to compare the outcomes with those obtained after median sternotomy (MST). METHODS: Between 1991 and 2007, a total of 140 patients with stage I and II thymoma underwent surgery at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Of them, 58 underwent MST, 61 VATS, and 21 thoracotomy. Using a propensity score based on four variables (myasthenia gravis, tumor size on CT images, age, and Masaoka stage), 48 VATS-treated patients were matched to 48 patients who received MST. Outcomes compared included perioperative complications, length of stay, tumor recurrence, and survival. RESULTS: No operative deaths occurred in this study. VATS was associated with fewer intraoperative blood loss, and more patients in the VATS group were extubated in the operating room after surgery compared with the MST group (37.5 vs. 12.5 %, respectively, P = 0.005). The mean length of stay was shorter in the VATS group than in the MST group (5.8 vs. 7 days, respectively; P = 0.008). After a median follow-up of 53 months, five patients developed recurrent tumors (four pleural and one pericardial). No statistically significant differences were found in the 5-year survival rates between the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: VATS appears feasible for patients with stage I and II thymoma and is associated with better perioperative outcomes than MST. The oncological outcomes are also similar.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease manifested by muscle weakness and fatigability. People with MG often experience downward fluctuations in physical and mental ability. Quality of life is impaired in MG. Thymectomy has become increasingly accepted as an efficacious procedure for MG. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of life in a patients with MG and to determine the prognostic factors predicting MG outcome after operation. DESIGN/METHODS: A total of 24 subjects (mean age 53; 75[percnt] women) was divided into two groups, first group with 12 patients after extended trans-sternal thymectomy (TY) and second one is consisting of 12 patients submitted to conservative treatment (CT) according to age and gender. The following data were analyzed: gender, age, and age at the beginning of symptoms, illness duration, follow-up time and type of medical treatment. The patients were evaluated clinically using a quantified MG clinical score (QMGS) and tested by SF-36 self-reported. RESULTS: We found out improved (normal SF-36 items and lower QMGS) 14 cases (TY 9, CT 5), improved with partial and minimal limitation 6 cases (TY 2, CT 4), and downgraded (bad SF-36 items and higher QMGS) 4 cases (TY 1, CT 3). No death was found in this group. Clinical remission was reached by 25 [percnt] patients (3 women), who had thymectomies in the first year of diseaes. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained data revealed that thymectomy has advantages over conservative treatment in clinical improvement and quality of life. There were statistical differences between the conservative treatment and thymectomy groups. Our results showe that patients who have had catamnesis less than 1 year duration of disease demonstate a better prognosis.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the popularity of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) techniques in clinical, thymoma patients via VATS thymectomy are increasing rapidly. However, compared with open thymectomy, the potential superiorities and defects of VATS thymectomy remain controversial. METHODS: A number of 129 patients who underwent thymectomy of early stage thymoma (Masaoka stage I and stage II) in one single center from January 2007 to September 2013 were selected in this retrospective study. Of those patients, 38 thymoma patients underwent VATS thymectomy (VATS group) and 91 underwent open thymectomy (open group) via either transsternal [44] or transthoracic approach [47] in the same period. The postoperative variables, which included postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS), the intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, the entire resection ratio, the number of thoracic drainage tubes, the quantity of output and duration of drainage, were analyzed. Meanwhile, the operation time and blood loss were considered as intraoperative variables. RESULTS: All thymoma patients in the analysis included 19 thymoma patients with myasthenia gravis, among which five patients via VATS thymectomy and 14 patients via open thymectomy respectively. There was no death or morbidity due to the surgical procedures perioperatively. The ICU LOS, operation time, entire resection ratio, and the number of chest tubes were not significantly different in two groups. The postoperative hospital LOS of VATS thymectomy was shorter than that of open thymectomy (5.26 versus 8.32 days, P<0.001). The blood loss of VATS thymectomy was less than open thymectomy (114.74 versus 194.51 mL, P=0.002). Postoperatively, the quantity of chest tubes output in VATS group was less than that in open thymectomy group (617.86 versus 850.08 mL, P=0.007) and duration of drainage in VATS group was shorter than that in open thymectomy group (3.87 versus 5.22 days, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VATS thymectomy is a safe and practicable treatment for early-stage thymoma patients. Thymoma according with Masaoka staging I-II without evident invading seems to be performed through VATS approach appropriately, which has shorter postoperative hospital LOS, less blood loss and less restrictions to activities, hence patients will recover sooner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the outcomes between patients who had undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy and transsternal (TS) thymectomy for Masaoka stage I and II thymoma. METHODS: The outcomes of 262 patients without myasthenia gravis who had undergone surgery for Masaoka stage I and II thymoma from January 2008 to December 2012 at our center were retrospectively evaluated. The study included 125 patients who had undergone unilateral VATS thymectomy (VATS group) and 137 patients who had undergone TS thymectomy (TS group). RESULTS: The VATS group had a shorter operative time than the TS group (170 vs 210 minutes, P < .001). The VATS group also had a smaller intraoperative blood loss (200 vs 450 mL, P < .001), smaller pleural drainage volume in the first 24 hours postoperatively (300 vs 500 mL, P < .0010), shorter postoperative pleural drainage duration (3 vs 5 days, P < .001), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (8 vs 10 days, P < .001). Four patients in the VATS group underwent conversion to open surgery because of injury to the innominate vein. The postoperative complication rate was similar between the 2 groups. One patient in the VATS group developed pleural recurrence, and one in the TS group developed local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral VATS thymectomy for Masaoka stage I and II thymoma is technically feasible and safe and is less invasive than TS thymectomy, with a shorter duration of surgery, less intraoperative blood loss, less postoperative pleural drainage, shorter postoperative pleural drainage duration, and shorter postoperative hospital stay. We have concluded that it is preferable to perform VATS thymectomy, although perhaps under certain circumstances sternotomy might be preferred. The oncologic outcomes were comparable between the 2 procedures. Additional follow-up is required to evaluate the long-term outcomes.

Of these 74 patients, 23 underwent thymoma resection using unilateral robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS group), and 51 underwent transsternal thymectomy (TST group). Duration of surgery, amount of intraoperative blood loss, duration of chest drainage, duration of postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in the RATS groups (61.3 ml) than in the TST group (466.1 ml) (p < 0.01). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the RATS group (3.7 vs 11.6 days; p < 0.01). No patients in the RATS group underwent conversion to open surgery. No severe surgical complications (e.g., bleeding caused by injury to the left brachiocephalic vein) and only one case of pulmonary atelectasis (appearing in a male patient 2 days after surgery) were detected in this series. CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy for early-stage thymomas is technically feasible, safe, and less invasive for the patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We performed this study to assess early clinical outcomes of robot-assisted surgery for anterior mediastinal mass by comparing results of the robot group with those of the sternotomy group after propensity score matching. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, 145 patients underwent resection of anterior mediastinal mass. Robot-assisted surgery was performed in 37 patients, and conventional surgery by sternotomy in 108 patients. Propensity score matching was done between two groups with variables of age, sex, size of the mass, myasthenia gravis, resection of other organ and pathological diagnosis. Thirty-four patients from the robot group and 34 from the open group were matched, fitting the model. The clinical outcomes of matched groups were compared. RESULTS: In the robot group, mediastinal cyst consisted of 47.1% (16 of 34), thymoma 32.4% (11 of 34), thymic carcinoma 8.8% (3 of 34), thymic hyperplasia 8.8% (3 of 34) and liposarcoma 2.9% (1 of 34). The mean duration of follow-up was 1.11 +/- 0.21 and 1.85 +/- 0.19 years for the robot and open groups, respectively. There were no mortality or recurrence in both groups during the follow-up. There were no significant differences in operation time, postoperative white blood cell and C-reactive protein increase, maximum visual analogue scale score for pain as well as postoperative intensive care unit care between the two groups. The robot group revealed a lesser number of drains (1.09 +/- 0.1 vs 1.41 +/- 0.1) and 24-h tube drainage (189.4 +/- 20.5 vs 397.6 +/- 52.6 ml), lower haemoglobin loss (0.54 +/- 0.4 vs 1.35 +/- 0.1 g/dl) and haematocrit decrease (1.92 +/- 0.5 vs 3.85 +/- 0.4%), shorter chest tube days (1.53 +/- 0.2 vs 3.06 +/- 0.2) and length of hospital stay (2.65 +/- 0.2 vs 5.53 +/- 0.8) after operation, which were all statistically significant. Although statistically insignificant, there were no postoperative complications in the robot group, but there were 5 (14.7%) in the open group (P = 0.063). CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients with relatively smaller sized masses, robot-assisted surgery resulted in excellent early clinical outcomes with lesser tube drainage, lower blood loss, shorter tube days and length of hospital stay without any postoperative complications, compared with the matched open group. Further investigation for long-term clinical outcomes and oncological outcomes is required for a robotic approach. Particularly, long-term follow-up for the local recurrence rate according to the pathological diagnoses is required.

AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: Does repeat thymectomy improve symptoms in patients with refractory myasthenia gravis after thymectomy? A total of 189 papers were found using the reported search, of which seven represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The outcome measures included operative mortality and morbidity, as well as long-term remission rate. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. All the studies were small (4-21 patients), retrospective, single institutional case series. There was considerable heterogeneity in the studies. The interval between the first and second operation ranged from less than a year to over 10 years. The operative approach of the initial operation included transcervical, trans-sternal and substernal approaches. The maximal medical therapy received by the patients prior to reoperation varied from anticholinesterase alone to cytotoxic therapy and regular plasmapheresis. The severity of symptoms ranged from Osserman Class IIa to V. The operative approach to re-thymectomy included resternotomy, thoracoscopy and a combination of both. There was no perioperative mortality. One study reported injury to the innominate vein at resternotomy in 3 (14.3%) patients. One study reported myasthenic crisis in 2 patients in the postoperative period. Only one study reported complete remission in 2 patients. In general, however, 52-95% of patients reported some improvement. There was no consistent, objective measure of improvement in these studies. We conclude that repeat thymectomy for patients with refractory myasthenia gravis after previous thymectomy is safe especially for patients whose first procedure was transcervical. Complete remissions are rare but, in these small series, 60-70% of patients report improvement. Clinical improvement appears to be associated with the presence of residual thymic tissue at the second operation, but these cannot be reliably identified on preoperative imaging. Patient selection remains driven by symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to compare operative variables and postoperative outcomes in adult patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing thymectomy through 3 different operative techniques: total median sternotomy, partial median sternotomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopy. METHODS: 30 patients aged 20-65 years were included in this study. They were subdivided into: group A: 8 patients undergoing thymectomy through a total median sternotomy; group B: 9 patients undergoing thymectomy through a partial median sternotomy; and group C: 13 patients undergoing thymectomy through video-assisted thoracoscopy. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables, and mortality were compared among groups. RESULTS: Preoperative variables were well matched in all groups. Operative time was significantly longer in group C. There was no intraoperative complication in any group. Postoperative length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in group C. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 (10%) patients, mostly in groups A and B. There was no perioperative mortality in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thymectomy is as effective as the traditional open surgical approaches for thymectomy in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis. In addition, the improved cosmesis of the video-assisted approach ideally should lead to earlier thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Thymectomy may benefit patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) or myasthenia with thymomas. Currently, video-assisted (VA) thoracic surgery is popular and plays an important role in thymectomy. We compared the clinical outcomes of VA thymectomy with conventional transsternal (TS) approach to investigate the effectiveness of VA technology in the current era. METHODS: A retrospective review of our thymectomy results for patients with MG from 1998 to 2011 was conducted. A total of 83 consecutive patients were enrolled. According to the surgeons' and patients' preference, 39 patients received conventional TS thymectomy and 44 were operated on in a VA fashion. The results were categorized and analyzed according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) postintervention statuses with some modification. RESULTS: No obvious difference between conventional TS thymectomy and VA thymectomy was noted regarding the remission statuses and the clinical outcomes by the modified MGFA score. However, the patients who received VA thymectomy showed shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays (4.2 +/- 3.3 days vs. 2.3 +/- 1.5 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with the conventional TS thymectomy, the VA approach is similarly effective with shorter ICU stays.

AB  - Background: For thymoma, the feasibility of resection via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) remains controversial. The objective of our study was to compare the outcomes of VATS and transsternal thymectomy in order to evaluate the efficacy of the VATS method for treatment of early stage thymoma. Methods: This study is a retrospective study of 120 patients who underwent thymectomy of early stage thymoma (Masaoka stage I and II) in a single medical center from 1991 to 2010. Of these patients, 76 patients underwent VATS thymectomy (VATS group) and 44 patients underwent the conventional transsternal approach (sternotomy group). We applied the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and time to tumor recurrence (TTR) of these two groups. Results: The mean follow-up time was 61.9 months in the VATS group and 69.7 months in the sternotomy group. There was no surgery-related mortality or major complication. The VATS group had smaller specimen size (p < 0.05) and tumor size (p < 0.01), shorter length of stay (LOS) in the hospital (p < 0.01), and shorter duration of chest tube drainage (p < 0.05) than the sternotomy group. There were no significant differences between the two groups for OS, RFS, and TTR. Conclusions: In early stage thymoma, VATS thymectomy associated with shorter hospital LOS and shorter duration of pleural drainage compared with the conventional transsternal approach. Otherwise, the two approaches had similar oncologic outcomes during the mean 60-month follow-up period. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.

AB  - Objectives: Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (VATT) is widely used to treat myasthenia gravis (MG), but it is still controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of studies that compared safety and efficacy of VATT and open thymectomy in order to determine which is the better choice. Methods: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Two authors independently reviewed each study and extracted data on perioperative mortality, overall morbidity, complete stable remission (CSR), occurrence of MG crises, operative time, intraoperative blood loss and postoperative hospital stay. Results: VATT was superior to open thymectomy in CSR (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59, P = 0.01), overall morbidity (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.95, P = 0.03) and occurrence of MG crisis (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17-0.55, P < 0.001 [ACR1]), but the two techniques did not differ significantly in mortality (P = 0.47). Compared with the open thymectomy group, operative time is significantly longer in VATT group (SMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.49, P = 0.03) while intraoperative blood loss is less (SMD -2.07, 95% CI -2.36 to -1.77, P < 0.001) and postoperative hospital stay is shorter (SMD -0.70, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.23, P = 0.004) There is no difference between the two groups of thymo-fatty tissue resected. However substantial heterogeneity was found in operative time (chi<sup>2</sup> = 108.50, I2 = 93%), post-hospital stay (chi<sup>2</sup> = 13.39, I2 = 78%) and intraoperative blood loss (chi<sup>2</sup> = 188.78, I2 = 98%). Conclusions: These results suggest that VATT is associated with greater efficacy and safety than open thymectomy, making it potentially a better choice of surgical approach for myasthenia gravis patients.

AB  - Background: Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy was developed more than 10 years ago and has become a widely accepted surgical approach. Most published reports regarding this procedure have focused on the right-sided approach. Since left-sided approach chest surgery is the first choice in cases of right pleural adhesion, large left thymus tumors, and tumors in close contact with the great vessels of the left pericardium, we performed thoracoscopic thymectomy using the left-sided approach in 52 cases and summarize herein its technical feasibility, indications, and operative steps. Methods: Between February 2004 and October 2014, 52 patients (24 men, 28 women, median age: 50 years, ranging from 18 to 85 years), underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy using the left-sided approach. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation. Patients were placed in the right lateral decubitus position and three ports were made. The entire hemithorax was carefully examined, then mediastinal pleura was incised, and the thymus was bluntly dissected from the inferior polar extending to the superior polar. The thymic venous was clipped. Results: All procedures were carried out safely, including simple thymectomy (n = 43) and extended thymectomy (n = 9). There were no operative deaths or serious complications, and there were seven cases of conversion to open thoracotomy. The mean operative duration was 105.3 minutes (ranging from 80 to 140 minutes). The mean blood loss was 78.5 ml (ranging from 20 to 200 ml), and there was no blood transfusion required. All patients were well throughout the follow-up period. Conclusions: The left-sided approach for video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy was a safe approach and could be an alternative procedure to the right-sided approach for the same procedure.

AB  - Background: Thymectomy is an established treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG). Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)-extended thymectomy is now being accepted by surgeons and patients, few reports document the long-term prognosis of generalized MG patients treated with VATS compared with those who underwent standard open thymectomy. Objective: To compare the outcomes of MG patients after VATS and open thymectomy (transsternal approach) and those treated non-surgically. Methods: A retrospective review of 26 consecutive patients diagnosed with generalized MG between 1998 and 2008 was conducted. Of the 26 patients, seven underwent thymectomy using VATS, 14 underwent thymectomy via a transsternal approach, and five were treated non-surgically. Preoperative classification and postoperative prognosis at 5 years were compared between the three groups. Results: The mean age of patients at the start of treatment was 38.9, 45.4, and 78.2 years in the VATS, transsternal, and non-surgical groups, respectively. Thymomas were found in two and five patients in the VATS and transsternal groups, respectively, while no thymomas were found in the non-surgical group. Positive outcomes (defined by complete remission, pharmacologic remission, or minimal manifestations status using under 5 mg/day prednisone) were achieved in 57% of patients in the VATS group versus 79% of patients in the transsternal group (P = 0.28). The treatment outcome of surgical therapy was significantly better than that of medical therapy alone. The mean length of hospital stay was 8.6 and 12.3 days in the VATS and transsternal groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Thymectomy is an effective treatment for patients with generalized MG and both surgical approaches achieve similar long-term outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a common chronic disorder of neuromuscular transmission, frequently treated surgically. Little is known about perioperative cellular immune responses following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) when compared with open resection. METHODS: Between January and December 2009, 127 patients with non-thymomatous MG underwent surgery, with 54 undergoing VATS and 73 undergoing conventional trans-sternal extended thymectomy (TS). Operative details, ectopic thymic tissue findings, postoperative concentrations of serum immunoglobulin and complement components as well as T-cell immunity were compared in the VATS and TS groups. RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in patients' age, gender, preoperative duration of MG and operation time. Patients who underwent VATS had a lower rate of postoperative stay in the intensive care unit (P = 0.02), less blood loss (P = 0.01) and a lower probability of ectopic thymic tissue. Prominent cellular immunity difference occurred in serum IgG and C3 concentrations and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts between the VATS and TS groups. In VATS patients, serum IgG concentration increased slightly on postoperative days 1 and 3. C3 concentration increased gradually in both groups after surgery, but decreased by postoperative day 7. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts were relatively stable postoperatively in the VATS group, but were markedly increased in the TS group on postoperative days 1 and 3, with CD4(+), but not CD8(+), T-cells declining on postoperative day 7. CONCLUSIONS: VATS for non-thymomatous MG has short-term advantages, with less effect on cellular immune responses than open resection.

AB  - Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of anterior mediastinum disease. The major surgical approaches include: cervical approach, mid-sternal approach, cervical combined mid-sternal approach and video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. The cervical approach is rarely adopted because of its restricted visual field. The cervical combined mid-sternal approach have a broader field of vision, given this advantage, the surgeon can remove the thymus and its surrounding fat tissue more thoroughly. But the trauma of this approach is much larger, and the postoperative complication is also a serious problem. The video-assisted thoracoscope is often adopted by left or right approach, this minimally invasive procedure can not remove anterior mediastinum fat thoroughly. In clinical practice, the investigators designed a new method named "3-Hole" subxiphoid approach. This study is designed to compare the safety and validity between this new method and others.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and assess the feasibility of robotic-assisted thymectomy for the treatment of Masaoka stage I. METHODS: We evaluated the short-term outcomes of 46 patients who underwent surgery for Masaoka stage I thymoma without myasthenia gravis between January 2009 and June 2012. Of these patients, 25 received unilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS group) and the rest 21 recieved unilateral robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS group). We evaluated the duration of surgery, amount of intraoperative blood loss, duration of chest drainage, duration of postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization costs, postoperative complications and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: The duration of surgery was not significantly different between the two groups. Intraoperative blood loss volumes did not differ significantly between the VATS and RATS groups (86.8 mL and 58.6 mL, respectively; P=0.168). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the RATS group (3.7 days vs. 6.7 days; P <0.01), and the postoperative pleural drainage volume of the RATS group was significantly less than VATS group (1.1 days vs. 3.6 days; P <0.01). No patients in the RATS group needed conversion to open surgery. However, in the VATS series, one patient had conversion to an open procedure. No surgical complications were observed except that one case had pulmonary atelectasis in the RATS group and one case developed pneumonia after surgery. Use of robot is much more expensive than video. No early recurrence was observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic thymectomy is feasible and safe for Masaoka stage I thymoma. RATS is equally minimally invasive as VATS and results in a shorter drainage period and reduced hospital stay compared with the VATS approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the benefits of administering perioperative high-dose prednisolone in conjunction with thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Class I to IIIB who had undergone an extended thymectomy between 1992 and 2009. Perioperative high-dose prednisolone was administered at starting doses of 10 to 20 mg and escalated up to 100 mg on alternate days. The treatment group comprised 70 patients receiving perioperative high-dose prednisolone, whereas the control group included 61 patients not treated with preoperative steroids. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, incidence of postoperative complications, and follow-up disease status. RESULTS: Prednisolone-treated patients presented with more advanced disease compared to controls (Class IIB or greater, 42 [60.0%] versus 7 [11.3%], respectively; P < 0.001). Mean preoperative%FVC was lower and FEV1.0% was higher in treated patients than in controls (%FVC: 92.4 +/- 2.3% versus 99.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively; P = 0.037, FEV1.0%: 85.2 +/- 1.3% versus 81.4 +/- 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.017). The groups were similar in other variables including presence of thymoma, and operative procedure. In the treatment group, disease status was significantly improved only by the induction of high-dose prednisolone before the surgery (P < 0.001), and these patients discontinued anti-cholinesterase therapy more frequently than controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, the treatment group demonstrated markedly lower rates of postoperative crisis (12.2% versus 2.9%, respectively; P = 0.045). The incidence of infection, wound dehiscence, and diabetes mellitus were comparable between groups. Survival analysis demonstrated higher rates of treated patients with improved disease status at three and five years (92% and 96%, respectively) compared to controls (57% and 76%, respectively; P < 0.001). Likewise, significantly greater proportions of treated patients achieved complete stable remission or pharmacologic remission at three, five, and ten years (23%, 42%, and 72%, respectively) compared to controls (10%, 20%, and 44%, respectively; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative high-dose prednisolone therapy is a safe, promising strategy for managing patients with myasthenia gravis and may reduce the incidence of postoperative crisis while improving disease status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In thymoma patients without myasthenia gravis, it is debatable whether thymectomy should be performed in addition to thymomectomy, the procedure in which the thymoma alone is resected. In this study, we proposed to compare the surgical results in early-stage nonmyasthenic thymoma patients who underwent thymomectomy with and without extended thymectomy. METHODS: A total of 95 patients without clinical evidence of preoperative myasthenia gravis, who underwent surgery for early-stage thymoma (stages I and II), were selected for the study. Thymomectomy with extended thymectomy was performed through median sternotomy on 42 patients, whereas thymomectomy without thymectomy was carried out through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy in 53 patients. Outcomes and surgical complications were compared between the two patient groups. RESULTS: The median duration of the follow-up was 57 months (6-121 months). Three patients, one in the thymomectomy group (1.9%) and two in the thymomectomy with thymectomy group (4.5%), developed tumor recurrences. Tumor recurrence rates between the two groups were not significantly different. During the follow-up period, we did not document the development of postoperative myasthenia gravis in any of the patients enrolled. Postoperative opioid use, the number of days of drainage, and hospitalization length were lower in patients undergoing thymomectomy through thoracotomy or VATS. CONCLUSIONS: In early-stage nonmyasthenic thymoma patients, thymomectomy without thymectomy through thoracotomy or VATS was associated with lower morbidity and shorter hospitalization, than thymomectomy with extended thymectomy. Postoperative myasthenia gravis did not develop in any of the patients enrolled in our study during the 57-month median follow-up period. Overall tumor recurrence rates were not significantly different between these two patient groups. On the basis of our results, we conclude that thymomectomy without thymectomy through thoracotomy or VATS is justified for early-stage nonmyasthenic thymoma patients, and longer follow-up is needed to investigate the necessity of thymectomy in this group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis remains controversial. The remission rate 5years after surgery varies from 13 to 51% in the literature. Sternotomy is the standard technique, though unacceptable by patients because of significant esthetic sequelae. Our objective was to demonstrate that the robot-assisted technique using the Da Vinci Surgical Robot II is at least as efficient and leaves fewer scars than the standard surgical technique. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 31 consecutive patients suffering from myasthenia gravis who underwent surgery in our center from January 1998 to March 2010. Ten patients with thymoma were excluded from this study. Two groups were formed: group 1 corresponding to patients treated with sternotomy, group 2 patients with robot-assisted technique. The duration of the hospital stay, the pain on D1, the degree of improvement at 1year according to Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification, the frequency of relapses, and perioperative treatment were studied. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 14 women and seven men. The mean age was 31.3years. The mean delay before surgery was 24months. Group 1 included 15 patients and group 2 had six patients. The complete remission rate at 1year was 9.5% (n=2). Surgery decreased the frequency of relapses after surgery (P=0.08) equally in the two groups. The duration of hospital stay and the pain level on D1 in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (P=0.02 and P<0.001). The degree of postoperative improvement was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.31). CONCLUSION: The results at 1year are fully comparable for sternotomy and the robot-assisted technique. The robot provides additional benefits of minimally invasive techniques: minimal esthetic sequelae in often young patients, less parietal morbidity (including pain), shorter hospital stays. Our complete remission rate, lower than those in the literature, must be considered taking into account the early nature of these results. The surgical robot, because of its many advantages, appears to be a promising technique and should facilitate the early management of these patients.

AB  - Objective: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be used for resection of various mediastinal tumors. However, a VATS approach for thymoma is still controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the VATS and open surgery to see whether VATS thymectomy could be used as successfully to treat early-stage thymoma. Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, we retrospectively reviewed 58 patients (29 males and 29 females) with early-stage (Masaoka stage I, II) thymoma who underwent thymectomy in our institution. All of the patients had no associated myasthenia gravis. Of these, VATS was performed in 30 patients (the VATS group) and open (trans-sternal) surgery was performed in 28 patients (the open group). Demographic and clinical features, surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Mean age was 53.0 +/- 13.9 years (range, 11 to 77 years). Among the VATS group, 17 patients were operated by right-sided (56.7%), and the others were operated by left-sided (43.3%). One patient in the VATS group required conversion to posterolateral thoracotomy because of severe adhesion between the tumor and the mediastinal pleura which mimicked invasion to the lung. There was no in-hospital mortality. The difference between the VATS and open groups in mean age (51.7 +/- 14.1 years vs. 54.5 +/- 13.9, p=0.456); male:female ratio (13:17 vs. 16:12, p=0.431); morbidity (3.4% vs. 10.3%, p=0.138) were not statistically significant. However, mean tumor size (4.7 +/- 1.5 cm vs. 7.1 +/- 2.5 cm, p < 0.001), mean operation time (79.7 +/- 29.8 min vs. 129.8 +/- 35.9 min, p < 0.001) and mean duration of postoperative hospital stay (3.7 +/- 2.4 days vs. 9.3 +/- 3.2 days, p < 0.001) were significantly different. During the follow-up period, none of the patients died from thymoma-related causes. There was no difference in recurrence rate between the two groups (10.0% vs. 10.7%, p=1.000). Conclusions: Our data indicate that VATS thymectomy for early-stage thymoma is technically feasible and can produce satisfactory surgical outcomes. But, further investigation with long-term follow-up is needed.

AB  - Objective: Thymectomy is well established in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Numerous techniques for performance of thymectomy have been described and published. We conducted this study to compare the outcomes of the three distinctly different operative techniques which are thymectomy through total median sternotomy, partial median sternotomy and video-assisted thoracoscopy. Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2011, Thirty patients (9 male and 21 female) aged 20 65 years were included in this study. Patients were subdivided into three groups: in group (A) 10 patients underwent thymectomy through total median sternotomy, in group (B) 10 patients underwent thymectomy through partial median sternotomy and in group (C) 10 patients underwent thymectomy through video-assisted thoracoscopy. Preoperative, intra-operative, postoperative variables and mortality are compared in all groups. Results: In all groups, preoperative variables were well matched for age, sex and preoperative clinical staging according to the MGFA clinical classification. Operative time was statistically highly significant; it was longer in Group (C). There was no intra-operative complication in all groups. Also, postoperative length of hospital stay was statistically highly significant; it was shorter in Group (C). Postoperative complications occurred in three patients (10%) mostly in group (A) and group (B). There was no perioperative mortality in all groups. Conclusions: We conclude that video-assisted thymectomy is effective as the traditional open surgical approaches for performance of thymectomy in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis. In addition, the improved cosmesis of the video-assisted approach ideally will lead to earlier thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is an established treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG), and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy has become an acceptable surgical procedure. This study aimed to compare the results of VATS thymectomy and open thymectomy and to identify the prognostic factors after thymectomy. METHODS: The clinical data of 187 consecutive thymectomies performed between July 2000 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed; 75 open thymectomies and 112 VATS thymectomies. Clinical efficacy and variables influencing outcome were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: The operative blood loss in the VATS group was significantly less than that in the open group ((62.14 +/- 55.43) ml vs. (137.87 +/- 165.25) ml, P < 0.05). The postoperative crisis rate increased with the severity of preoperative MG and the prescription dose of anticholinesterase. Complete follow-up information of patients more than 12 months after the thymectomy was obtained on 151 cases, 89 cases from the VATS group and 62 cases from the open group, with a mean follow-up period of 59.3 months, range from 12 to 117 months. Complete stable remission (CSR) was the end point for evaluation of the treatment results. The overall five-year CSR rate was 57.5%. Two good prognostic factors were identified; preoperative prescription of anticholinesterase alone (P = 0.035) and non-thymomatous MG (P = 0.003). The five-year CSR rate of the ocular type of MG reached a high level of 67.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy can achieve good long-term CSR in MG, and VATS is an ideal alternative method. High-dose prescription of anticholinesterase and the advanced stage by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification have higher risks of postoperative crisis. Preoperative prescription of anticholinesterase alone and non-thymomatous MG are good prognostic factors. Thymectomy should also be considered for the ocular type of MG.

AB  - Objectives: Thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG) is well-established; patients with thymoma, early disease and severe symptoms benefit most. There is now a tendency to refer patients with increasingly severe disease for earlier thymectomy. However, in the short term thymectomy does not bring about immediate relief and can precipitate myasthenic crisis. The aim of this study is to review our experience of thymectomy on patients with the severest symptom - recent myasthenic crisis. Methods: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study. Between 2005 and 2012, 50 patients underwent thymectomy for MG. Of these, 12 patients (9 females and 3 males, mean age 45.2, 6 thymomatous MG) had prior myasthenic crisis, defined as respiratory failure requiring intensive care (ICU) admission. Results: During the crisis episodes, 8 patients required intubation, 1 required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and 3 required neither. At the time of operation, 3 patientswere still in ICU: onewas intubated and 2 required NIV. Themedian interval between crisis-onset and thymectomy (5 trans-sternal, 6 thoracoscopic and 1 robotic) was 56.5 days (range 9-233). Preoperatively, 9 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 4 underwent plasmapheresis. Therewere no postoperative deaths or long-term morbidity. The median ICU stay was 1 day (interquartile range [IQR] 1-8) and in-hospital stay was 10.5 days (IQR 5.2-17.8). The three ICU patients had the longest ICU and in-hospital stay (median 14 and 108 days respectively). Median follow-up was 65 months. There were no complete remissions. Eight and 7 patients had reduced pyridostigmine and prednisolone doses respectively. Four patients had further crises. We compared the 6 patients operated early (group E, median interval 21.5 days) with 6 patients operated later (group L, 104.5 days). All 4 patients with recurrentmyasthenic crisis were in group L (P=0.03). Conclusions: With modern management of MG, early surgery with myasthenic crisis is safe with good long-term outcomes.

AB  - Background: . Thymomas are the most common tumors of the anterior mediastinum. Clinical manifestations of thymomas depend on their endocrine activity, growth pattern and size. Non-invasive thymomas are mostly asymptomatic. According to different authors, more than 75% of thymomas are combined with myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis affects people of working age, is characterized by a progressive course and often leads to disability. In the last decade, as a result of the active introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques to the practice, the question of the choice of surgical approach between open access and endoscopic surgery remains to be open. Methods: In the period 2002-2012 45 patients with tumor and hyperplasia of thymus were treated in Perm regional clinical hospital. Mean age was 43.9 years. Women of working age prevailed among the patients - 31 (68.8%). During examination hyperplasia of thymus was revealed in 15 patients, thymoma in 30 patients besides 5 of them had invasive malignant tumor growth. Among patients with hyperplasia of thymus (15 patients) the clinic of myasthenia was revealed in 9 cases (60%), 5 of them had generalized form and 4 - local form of myasthenia. In the group of patients with tumor of thymus (30 patients) myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in 26 of them, which amounted to 86.6%. Thus generalized form of myasthenia gravis was observed in 24 patients (92,3%), and its local forms were revealed only in 2 cases. Results: Surgical treatment was performed in 42 patients, that is 93.3%. In 3 patients surgical treatment wasn't carried out due to the presence of severe comorbidity. Sternotomy and extended thymectomy was performed in 25 patients, thymectomy through thoracotomy was performed in 4 cases. Since 2008 endoscopy (VATS) started to be used for thymectomy (pic. 2A, pic.2B). It was carried out in 13 patients, but in 3 cases complementary (extra) minithoracotomy was required because of the intraoperatively diagnosed invasion of large vessels. Pic. 2 A Pic. 2 B General postoperative mortality was 4.5%. Two patients after VATS died. They had invasion of the tumor to the mediastinal great vessels and the endoscopic operation required a conversion to thoracotomy because of the massive intraoperational blood loss. The regression of neurological symptoms and the decrease of necessity of the anticholinesterase drugs were revealed in all the patients that were operated. Conclusion: In spite of the technical capability for extended thymectomy and less traumatic rate of the endoscopic method we consider that a complete longitudinal sternotomy is better in cases of invasion of tumor to the mediastinal great vessels or in suspicion on presence of aberrant thymic tissue in the mediastinal and neck cellular spaces.

AB  - Objectives: Thymectomy is recognised as an effective surgical treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG) and certain thymomas. Median sternotomy remains the most frequent approach. This study demonstrates the favourable cost of the less invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) technique. Methods: We identified 78 patients who underwent thymectomy, 39 VATS and 39 open, over a 7-year period. For the VATS group, mean age was 35 +/- 15.8 and 33 were females; for the open group, mean age was 48.5 +/- 18.6 and 23 were females. Patients with stable and unstable MG and with small thymomas were included in both groups. Variables compared were duration of operation, cost of equipment, major complications and length of stay. Results: The estimated duration of operation based on theatre records is 180 min for VATS thymectomy and 90 min for open thymectomy. The operative costs are greater for VATS thymectomy: the intraoperative staffing costs are 498 for VATS thymectomy and 249 for open thymectomy and the costs of equipment are 404 and 184, respectively. However, the length of postoperative stay (median and interquartile range) in the VATS group was 2.5 days (2.0-3.2) compared to 5.1 days (4.2-7.2) in the open group (P < 0.001). Taking into account the planned postoperative ICU admission for patients with MG, the median cost of postoperative stay was calculated as 1940 (1740-2220) in the VATS group and 2960 (2620-3810) in the open group (P < 0.001). Major complications in the open group included an upper limb DVT and AF; there were three mortalities within 18 months follow-up. In the VATS group, one patient with MG developed a phrenic nerve neuropraxia. Overall, a saving of 551 was made for each VATS thymectomy performed compared to open thymectomy. Conclusions: VATS thymectomy is cost-effective. We advocate a greater adoption of this technique despite greater equipment costs.

AB  - Complete resection could be achieved in virtually all myasthenic patients with Masaoka stage I and II thymoma using the trans-sternal technique. Whether this is appropriate for minimally invasive approach is not yet clear. We evaluated the feasibility of complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy for the treatment of Masaoka stage I and II thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis, compared to conventional trans-sternal thymectomy. We summarized 33 patients with Masaoka stage I and II thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis between April 2006 and September 2011. Of these, 15 patients underwent right-sided complete VATS (the VATS group) by using adjuvant pneuomomediastinum, comparing with 18 patients using the trans-sternal approach (the T3b group). No intraoperative death was found and no VATS case required conversion to median sternotomy. Significant differences between the two groups regarding duration of surgery and volume of intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) were observed. Postoperative morbidities were 26.7% and 33.3% for the VATS and T3b groups, respectively. All 33 patients were followed up for 12 to 61 months in the study. The cumulative probabilities of reaching complete stable remission and effective rate were 26.7% (4/15) and 93.3% (14/15) in the VATS group, which had a significantly higher complete stable remission and effective rate than those in the T3b group (P = 0.026 and P = 0.000, respectively). We conclude that VATS thymectomy utilizing adjuvant pneuomomediastinum for the treatment of stage I and II thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis is technically feasible but deserves further investigation in a large series with long-term follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thymectomy is a surgical treatment of myasthenia gravis. Our goal is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of myasthenia gravis with or without thymoma and a review of the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study over a period of 10 years (2001-2010) on 43 patients: 28 women and 15 men with a mean age of 39.3 years (range 16-68 years). The myasthenia gravis was confirmed by clinical, electromyographic data and the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors. RESULTS: Computed tomography objectified thymic mass in 14 cases (32.5%) enlarged thymus without visible mass in eight cases (18.6%). All patients received anticholinesterase, cortico steroids in 25 cases and in three cases plasmapheresis was required. The surgical approach was total sternotomy (n=32 cases), cervicotomy (n=2), cervical and manubriotomy (n=1), a manubriotomy (n=3) and a thoracotomy in five cases (lateralised thymoma). All patients underwent a total thymectomy associated or not with resection of the tumour. Intensive Care Unit was necessary for at least 24h up to six days. The postoperative course was marked by a myasthaenic crisis (n=2) and respiratory failure (n=3) with a favourable outcome. The prognosis was marked by a complete remission in 14 cases, partial remission in 11 patients, stabilisation (n=16 cases) and increasing crisis in two patients. CONCLUSION: Thymectomy certainly allows clinical improvement and reduced crisis of myasthenia gravis. Long term monitoring will confirm the benefit of non-oncological thymectomy alone or in combination with standard treatments for patients with generalised myasthenia gravis without thymoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of myasthenic patients with and without thymoma, and the results of thymectomy in both types of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 66 patients who underwent thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in our department over a 10-year period (2000-2010). The surgical approach was sternotomy or anterolateral thoracotomy. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of thymoma: with (T-MG) and without (NT-MG) thymoma. Complete stable remission (CSR) was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Median age was 35.09+/-9.89 years. The NT-MG group had 38 patients (57.57%) and the T-MG group 28 patients (42.43%). There was no difference between the two groups regarding the surgical approach (P=0.52). T-MG patients were older (40.54+/-15.16 vs. 31.37+/-9.46) (P=0.008) and predominantly male. There were more generalized forms (P=0.01) and more bulbar involvement (P=0.02) in the T-MG group. The rate of CSR at 5 years was 7% and 17% in the T-MG and NT-MG patients respectively (P=0.70). At 10 years, it was 36% and 94.73% respectively (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Thymomatous myasthenia gravis is characterized by the severity of its clinical features. Remission rate at 10 years was significantly lower in the myasthenia with thymoma group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) may include thymectomy. The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) extended thymectomy and to compare characteristics of patients with MG with and without thymoma. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2009, 247 patients with MG underwent VATS thymectomy in our department and were subdivided into 2 groups: MG without thymoma (n=176) and MG with thymoma (n=71). Complete stable remission (CSR) was the primary endpoint for efficacy. RESULTS: There were no intraoperative deaths and 4 cases required conversion to median sternotomy. There was a significant difference between the 2 groups regarding preoperative and postoperative myasthenic crisis. Two hundred nineteen patients were followed for 4 months to 9 years: 152 had thymoma and 67 did not have thymoma. The cumulative probabilities of reaching CSR were 37.5% in patients with MG without thymoma and 28.3% in patients with thymoma, respectively. Forty months after surgery there was no significant difference in CSR between the 2 groups. Two years after surgery, 30 patients without thymoma achieved CSR and disease was exacerbated in 2 patients after CSR had been achieved. Ten patients with thymoma achieved CSR, and exacerbation occurred in 5 patients with thymoma. Two patients without thymoma died of myasthenic crisis, whereas 3 of 4 patients with thymoma died of myasthenic crisis, and 1 death was attributable to recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery thymectomy can produce a satisfactory long-term result. MG with thymoma seems more severe and its prognosis after thymectomy is not as optimistic as that of MG without thymoma. Special perioperative attention should be paid to patients with MG and thymoma to decrease the possibility of postoperative myasthenic crisis and reduce postoperative death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete thymectomy is the procedure of choice in the treatment of thymomas and in treating selected patients with myasthenia gravis. Transsternal thymectomy is the gold standard for most patients. Robot-assisted thymectomy has emerged as an alternative to open transsternal surgery. The goal of this study was to compare perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent transsternal or robot-assisted thymectomy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent robot-assisted or transsternal thymectomy at our institution from February 2001 to February 2010. Data are presented as mean +/- SD. Significance was set as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Fifty patients underwent either transsternal (n = 35) or robot-assisted (n = 15) thymectomy. Patient demographics and the incidence of myasthenia gravis were similar between groups. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery in the robot-assisted group. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly higher in the transsternal group (151.43 vs. 41.67 ml, P = 0.01). There were 20 postoperative complications and 1 postoperative death in the transsternal group and 1 postoperative complication in the robot-assisted group (P = 0.001). Hospital length of stay was 4 days (range 2-27 days) in the transsternal group and 1 day (range 1-7 days) in the robot-assisted group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted thymectomy is superior to transsternal thymectomy, reducing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, and hospital length of stay. Further investigation of the long-term oncologic results in thymoma patients and long-term remission rates in patients with myasthenia gravis who underwent robot-assisted thymectomy is warranted.

Methods: A retrospective, single-centre analysis of all patients with thymomas (n=122) operated on between the 1 January 1967 to 31 December 2011 at our institution was conducted. In the period 1967 - 1997 (group 1) upper partial sternotomy and lateral thoracotomy were the preferred approaches and resection of the thymus with thymoma without the surrounding fatty tissue were performed. In the years 1997 - 2006 (group 2) complete sternotomy approach and extended thymectomy were performed. Starting from 2007 - 2011 (group 3) complete sternotomy approach has been done selectively only in Masaoka stage III-IV thymomas. The other patients underwent videothoracoscopy- assisted (VATS) extended thymectomy. Results: There were no significant differences between 3 groups in regard to the age, women/men rate, proportion of A and AB vs B1 - 3 and C types according to the WHO classification and association with myasthenia gravis. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 in regard to the higher number of Masaoka stage III-IV (26/54 (48.1%) vs 5/26 (19.2%) and 10/42 (23.8%) patients, respectively), incomplete resection rate (5/52 (9.6%) vs 1/28 (3.6%) and 1/42 (2.3%) patients, respectively) and the recurrence of thymoma rate (9/54 (16.7%) vs 2/26 (7.7%) and 0/42 patients, respectively). Conclusions: The evolution of the surgical approach for thymomas expressed earlier discovery and less advanced stage at presentation and better completeness of operations for groups 2 and 3 in comparison to group 1. The introduction of the minimally invasive VATS thymectomy in group 3 had no adverse influence on the quality of resection.

AB  - Objective: For patients with nonthymomatous autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), thymectomy is recommended as an option to increase the probability of remission or improvement. The minimal invasive surgical technique used in these patients is reasonable. We present the data of patients after right-sided VATS thymectomy performed in the University Hospital in Pozna, Poland. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the results of treatment of 118 consecutive patients operated on due to nonthymomatous myasthenia from 1999 to 2010. The data were collected from the medical records and telephone surveys and completed in 112 patients. 6 patients missed from the follow-up. In this group patients were 21 male and 91 female in age ranged from 17 to 71 years old, mean 34.5 (+/- 13.5) yrs. Results: All 112 patients underwent right-sided VATS extended thymectomy. The conversion to small thoracotomy were necessary in 4 patients due to technical problems. The mean time of surgery was 111.9 minutes and ranged from 90-180 min. The median postoperative stay in hospital was 5.5 days. The mean duration of the disease before surgery was 23.9 months (range 20-170 months). There were no postoperative mortality, 4 patients (5.5%) required mechanical ventilation after surgery, no other serious morbidity was observed. Median follow-up was 58.9 months (12-170 months). The stage of the disease and postoperative status were assessed according to Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA). In 86.1% of patients improvement was considered. The complete stable remission (CSR) were observed in 22 patients (19.6%). The rate of CSR during first 12 months after thymectomy was only 6.5%. Conclusions: VATS thymectomy is a safe surgical procedure with no perioperative mortality and low morbidity and high acceptance among the patients. The long-term symptoms improvement is similar like in the other studies but the question, is the final rate of CSR, is related to thymectomy or postoperative medical treatment is still open.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An open thymectomy is a morbid procedure. If a minimally invasive thymectomy is performed without compromising the tenets of thymic surgery, it has the potential for decreasing morbidity and may offer similar clinical and oncologic results. METHODS: This is an institutional review board-approved, retrospective study of a single center's experience with both open (transsternal) and minimally invasive (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) thymectomy. Survival estimates and statistical comparisons were calculated using standard software. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2011, 263 patients (93 men; median age, 49 years; interquartile range, 37 to 60 years) underwent thymectomy for indications including myasthenia gravis (n=139) and mediastinal mass (n=108). Seventy-seven thymectomies were performed by minimally invasive approach. Both groups were equally stratified by sex, body mass index, World Health Organization and Masaoka-Koga staging, incidence of myasthenia gravis, and comorbidities except hyperlipidemia and diabetes. The minimally invasive thymectomy cohort had significantly shorter hospital (p<0.01) and intensive care unit lengths of stay (p<0.01) and a lower estimated blood loss (p<0.01). There was an insignificant difference in postoperative cardiac and respiratory complication rates as well as vocal cord paralysis (p=0.60). There was no difference in terms of operative room times (p=0.88) or volume of blood products transfused (p=0.16) between the two groups. Higher estimated blood loss was associated with higher intensive care unit admission rates (p<0.01). All minimally invasive thymoma resections were complete, with negative margins. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive thymectomy is safe and achieves a comparable resection and postoperative complication profile when used selectively for all indications, including myasthenia gravis and small thymomas without vascular invasion.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the results of repeated thymectomy (rethymectomy) for refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) after previous thymectomy. Methods: There were 36 rethymectomies performed in the period 1996- 2012. There were 30 women and 6 men, age before first thymectomy 14-61 years (mean 26.1), before rethymectomy 18-64 years (mean 34.3), time interval between first thymectomy and rethymectomy 2.1-16.2 years (mean 6.9). Steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs intake before was first thymectomy 16.7% (6/36) and before rethymectomy 66.7% (24/36). The initial thymectomy was performed through upper median sternotomy in 25 patients, complete median sternotomy in seven patients, unilateral videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in three patients (1 left, 2 ight) and transcervical- subxiphoid-VATS approach in one patient. Results: Extended rethymectomy was performed through complete median resternotomy in 30 patients and through transcervical-subxiphoid VATS approach in six patients. There was no mortality; perioperative morbidity was 11.1% (4/36). Thymic tissue was found in 30/36 patients (83.3%), including retained thymic lobe in 11 patients and/or ectopic foci of thymic tissue in 23 patients. The follow-up period was 3.2-17 years (mean 10.4 years). Complete remission of MG was found in 2/36 patients (5.6%) and improvement in 25/36 patients (69.4%). There was no deterioration of MG or late mortality. Steroids/immunosuppressive drugs intake was necessary only in 6/ 36 patients (16.7%). Conclusions: 1) Rethymectomy can be safely performed either with VATS resternotomy or with transcervical-subxiphoid-VATS approaches; 2) Complete remission and improvement rates were relatively low but deterioration of MG was prevented and steroids/immunosuppressive drugs intake could be discontinued in most patients.

AB  - Objectives: Different methods of open and minimal invasive thymectomies are recommended for myasthenia gravis in the literature. In this study, we analysed the results of the standard trans-sternal and 2 different types of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) thymectomies performed in one department. Methods: A total of 71 patients (60 females, 11 males; mean age: 31 (14 - 84) years) underwent thymectomy for MG: 23 standard trans-sternal thymectomies, 22 extended VATS thymectomies and 26 classic VATS thymectomies through the right side. Length of surgery and hospital stay, postoperative morbidity (respiratory insufficiency/ventilation, plasmaferesis, infection, chylothorax, bleeding), and improvement of myasthenia symptoms in an early 1- year period were compared. Osserman statuses of the MGs were as follows: I 13, IIA 37, IIB 11, III 7 and IV 3. The preoperative steroid/immunosuppression administration was 21.7%, 36.4% and 46.2% (P=0.201), and the plasmaferesis was 26.1%, 9.1% and 11.5% (P=0.226) in the standard trans-sternal, extended- VATS and classic-VATS groups, respectively. Follow-up period was 12 months. Results: There was no perioperative mortality. The length of thymectomy were 112, 211 and 116 min (P=0.001), and the length of hospital stay were 8.9, 5.6 and 4.0 (P=001) days in the standard trans-sternal, extended-VATS and classic-VATS groups, respectively. The postoperative morbidities were 26.1%, 31.8% and 7.7% (P=0.097), and the improvement rates were 91.3%, 94.7% and 87.5% (P=0.712) in the standard trans-sternal, extended-VATS and classic-VATS groups, respectively. Conclusions: All three types of thymectomy produced an excellent 1-yearperiod improvement in myasthenia symptoms, without significant differences. Extended VATS thymectomy caused the best improvement rate, but it had the most frequent postoperative morbidity. Less invasive, classic VATS thymectomy associated with the shortest length of surgery and hospital stay, and the least morbidity. There was no advantage of the standard trans-sternal thymectomy compared to the VATS methods.

AB  - The aim of this study was to discuss the new methods of clinical classification and staging of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) proposed by our group and to summarize the experiences of surgical treatment of MG with a novel incision by cutting the sternum cross-sectionally at the second intercostal level. A retrospective analysis was made for the clinical data from the patients with MG who underwent thymectomy from July 1988 to May 2009. The surgical procedures were designed into three groups, a group with Osserman classification and median incision of the sternum (Group 1), a group with MGFA typing (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) and a small transverse sternal incision at the second intercostal level (Group 2), and a group with new typing and a smaller transverse sternal incision at the second intercostal level (Group 3). Observation of the clinical typing and staging was made in the patients with myasthenia crisis. The parameters such as procedure duration in Group 2 and 3 was significantly lower than those in Group 1 (P < 0.05). The incidence of myasthenia crisis in Group 3 was significantly lower than that in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.05). The procedure with a smaller transverse sternal incision at the second intercostal level (Group 3) is a safer method for patients with MG. The combination of this procedure with the new typing and staging methods proposed by our group could facilitate the selection of operation indications and opportunity, resulting in the lower incidence of myasthenia crisis and mortality. Our new procedure is well deserved to be a preferential selection by other hospitals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the feasibility and safety of thoracoscopic thymectomy with conventional sternotomy thymectomy for thymoma without myasthenia gravis. METHODS: Data from 70 patients diagnosed with thymoma, who underwent thoracoscopic thymectomy (n = 25, Group T) or sternotomy thymectomy (n = 45, Group S) between March 2002 and March 2008, were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Mean follow-up durations were 78.0 +/- 21.9 months and 70.0 +/- 23.6 months in Groups T and S, respectively. No deaths occurred in Group T; seven deaths occurred in Group S, all > 1 month post follow-up. Durations of chest intubation and hospitalization were significantly shorter in Group T than in Group S. No significant between-group difference in the incidence of operative complications was observed. Tumour recurrence-free rates at 5 and 7 years postsurgery were 96% (both years) in Group T and 95% (both years) in Group S. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up indicates that thoracoscopic thymectomy for thymoma without myasthenia gravis is effective and is well tolerated, and associated with low rates of operative complications and recurrence.

AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was how video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) compares to median sternotomy in the surgical management of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG)? Overall 74 papers were found using the reported search, of which 15 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results are tabulated. We conclude that VATS produces equivalent postoperative mortality and complete stable remission (CSR) rates, with superior results in terms of hospital stay, operative blood loss and patient satisfaction at the expense of a doubling of operative time. Six studies comparing VATS and transsternal sternotomy in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (NTMG) patients found VATS to have lower operative blood loss (73.8+/-70.7 vs. 155.3+/-91.7 ml; P<0.05), reduced total hospital stay (5.6+/-2.2 vs. 8.1+/-3.0 days; P=0.008), whilst maintaining equivalent remission rates (33 vs. 44.7%; P=0.16) and mass of thymic tissue resection (37 vs. 34 g; P>0.05). One study comparing video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy to transsternal thymectomy in only thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis (T-MG) patients found equivalent CSR (11.3 vs. 8.7%, P=0.1090) at six-year follow-up. Thymoma recurrence rate (9.64%) was not significantly different (P=0.1523) between the two groups. Eight studies comparing VATS and transsternal approach in mixed T-MG and NTMG patients found a lower hospital stay (1.9+/-2.6 vs. 4.6+/-4.2 days, P<0.001), reduced need for postoperative medication (76.5 vs. 35.7%, P=0.022), lower intensive care unit stay (1.5 vs. 3.2 days, P=0.018), greater symptom improvement (100 vs. 77.9%, P=0.019) and better cosmetic satisfaction (100 vs. 83, P=0.042) with VATS. In concordance with NTMG and T-MG alone patient groups, VATS and transsternal methods had equivalent complication rates (23 vs. 19%, P=0.765) with no mortalities in either group. Even though VATS has a longer operative time (268+/-51 vs. 177+/-92 min, P<0.05), its improved cosmesis, reduced need for postoperative medication and equivalent disease resolution outcomes make it a preferable surgical option to the transsternal approach.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the different pathological and clinical characteristics of thymomas with and without myasthenia gravis (MG) and determine whether the presence of MG influences the prognosis in thymoma patients. Methods: We retrospectively studied data from 228 consecutive patients operated on from1992 to 2007 in the department of Thoracic Surgery of Beijing Tongren Hospital. These thymoma patients have been subdivided into two groups: Group A with MG (n=125) and Group B without MG (n=103). These patients underwent extended thymectomy using a transsternal approach (n=153) or VATS (n=75). All thymic epithelial tumors were classified according to the WHO histologic classification and the Masaoka clinical staging system. Results: There were no peri-operative deaths. 19 cases were inoperable. (6 in the group with MG, 13 without MG, P=0.035). The proportions of type A, AB, B1, B2, B3, and C thymoma in this data were 0%, 22.4%, 26.4%, 30.4%, 20.8%, and 0% respectively in the group with MG, and 10.5%, 13.4%, 23.6%, 24.5%, 16.4%, and 11.6% respectively in the group without MG. According to the modified Masaoka's clinical staging, in the group MG, 24.8 % patients were stage III and IV; in the group without MG, 33 % patients were stage III and IV. There was a significant difference between hyperplastic paraneoplastic thymus coexisting in 28.8% patients with MG and only 5.8% in patients without MG. Microthymoma was identified in the paraneoplastic thymus of 3 patients with MG. There were 198 patients followed up. There was no recurrence in patients with type A and a few patients with type AB, B1, B2, B3 and C recurred. The actuarial 5- and 10-year survival rates were 89.3% and 81.2% for patients with MG respectively, and 90% and 78.9% for patients without MG respectively. Within 5 years postoperatively, 6 of 9 patients with MG died of myasthenia crisis, while 6 out of 7 deaths in patients without MG were attributable to inoperable tumors (stage) and type C thymoma. Conclusion: MG seldom occurs in type A and C thymoma. In addition to resection of thymoma, all thymic tissue and mediastinal fat should also be completely removed to lower possibility of thymoma recurrence and achieving complete stable remission of MG. The prognosis of thymomas with MG is similar to that without MG. The main cause of death is myasthenia crisis for thymoma patients with MG and stage IV and /or type C for thymoma patients without MG.

AB  - Purpose - This study was conducted to compare perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted (RA) or traditional transsternal (TS) thymecotmy. Complete thymectomy is the procedure of choice in the treatment of thymomas and in the treatment of selected patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Transsternal thymectomy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of MG and thymomas. Robotic-assisted thymectomy has emerged as an alternative to open transsternal surgery and has become the procedure of choice for patients with thymoma or MG in our practice. Methods - We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent RA or TS thymectomy at our institution from February 2001 to February 2010. Data is presented as mean+/-SD. Student's t-test and Pearson chi square analyses were performed. Significance was set as p<0.05. Results - Fifty consecutive patients underwent either TS (35) or RA (15) thymectomy. Patient demographics were similar between groups. The incidence of MG was 5>15 in the TA group and 6>35 in the TS group (p=0.269). There were 10>15 patients with thymoma in the RA group and 14>35 in the TS group. Tumor size was 4.78+/-1.90 cm in the RA group and 4.41+/-1.08 in the TS group (p=0.569). There were no conversions to open surgery in the RA group and all procedures were completed robotically. Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in the TS group (151 ml vs. 41 ml, p=0.01). There were 11 postoperative complications in the TS group and 1 complication in the RA group (p=0.022). There was 1 mortality in the TS group and none in the RA group (p = 1.0). Hospital length of stay was 5.6+/-4 days in the TS group and 1.8+/-1.6 days in the RA group (p=0.002). Conclusions - Robotic-assisted thymectomy is superior to transsternal thymectomy, reducing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, and hospital length of stay. Further investigation of the long-term oncologic results in thymoma patients and long-term remission rates in patients with MG undergoing RA thymectomy are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Radical thymectomy has become more popular in the comprehensive treatment of myasthenia gravis. Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly used for thymectomy. The most recent development in robotic thoracoscopic surgery has been successfully applied for mediastinal pathologies. To establish robotic technique as a standard, the results of high-volume centers and comparison with traditional surgery are mandatory. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the results of 79 thoracoscopic thymectomies (October 1994 to December 2002) were compared with the results of 74 robotic thoracoscopic thymectomies (January 2003 to August 2006). Data from both series were collected prospectively. In both groups, all patients had myasthenia gravis. Both cohorts were compared with respect to severity of disease, gender, age, histology, and postoperative morbidity. All patients were analyzed for quantification of improvement of disease according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. RESULTS: There were no differences in age distribution and severity of myasthenia gravis. The dominant histologic finding was follicular hyperplasia of the thymus in both groups with a significantly higher percentage in the thoracoscopic thymectomy series (68% vs 45%, P < .001). After a follow-up of 42 months, the cumulative complete remission rate of myasthenia gravis for robotic and nonrobotic thymectomy was 39.25% and 20.3% (P = .01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is an improved outcome for myasthenia gravis after robotic thoracoscopic thymectomy compared with thoracoscopic thymectomy.

AB  - Introduction: Thymectomy in myasthenia gravis is controversial. Remission rate 5 years after surgery in literature varies from 13 to 51%. Sternotomy is the standard technique, not acceptable because of significant esthetic sequelae. Our objective was to demonstrate that the robotassisted technique is at least as efficient and leaves less scars than sternotomy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of 30 patients with myasthenia gravis operated on in our center from January 1998 to December 2009. Two groups were formed: group 1 corresponding to patients who received a sternotomy, group 2 patients the roboticassisted technique. Hospital stay, pain on D1, 1 year improvement according to De Filippi, frequency of relapses, perioperative treatment, have been particularly studied. Results: We identified 13 women and 7 men. The mean age was 31 years old. The mean delay before surgery was 24,8 m. Group 1 consisted of 15 patients, group 2 of 5. Complete remission rate at 1 year was 5%. Surgery decreased the frequency of relapses equally in the 2 groups. Hospitalization stay and pain on D1 in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1 (p=0.04, p=0.001). Postoperative improvement was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Results at 1 year of the 2 techniques are fully comparable. Robot provides additional benefits: minimal esthetic sequelae, less parietal morbidity, shorter hospital stays. Our complete remission rate, lower than those in the literature, must take into account the early nature of these results. The surgical robot appears to be a promising technique and should facilitate the early management of these patients.

AB  - Objective: The minimally invasive, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) approach to resection of the thymus is frequently practiced for benign disease; however, a VATS approach for thymoma remains controversial. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of VATS thymectomy for the treatment of early-stage thymoma and to compare the outcomes with those after open resection. Methods: A retrospective review of 40 patients who underwent surgical resection of early-stage thymoma during a 12-year period was conducted. Data on patient characteristics, morbidity, recurrence, and survival were collected. The primary endpoint studied was overall survival. Results: Of the 40 patients, 14 underwent thymectomy for stage I and 26 for stage II thymoma; 19 were men and 21 were women (median age, 64 years; range, 35-86 years). Open thymectomy was performed in 22 patients, and VATS was performed in 18. The operative mortality rate was 0%. The tumor stage and number of patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy were comparable in both surgical groups. The median length of hospital stay was shorter in the VATS group (3 days) than in the open group (5 days) (P = .0001). The median follow-up was 36 months. No significant differences were found in the estimated recurrence-free and overall 5-year survival rates (83%-100%) between the 2 groups. Conclusions: VATS of early-stage thymoma appears safe and feasible and was associated with a shorter hospital stay. The oncologic outcomes were comparable in the open and VATS groups during intermediate-term follow-up. Additional follow-up is required to evaluate the long-term results of thoracoscopic thymectomy for early-stage thymoma.

AB  - Objective: To describe a single institutional experience on the surgical management of thymoma. Methods: Retrospective study on patients who had thymectomy for presumed thymic pathology decided by CT/PET scan in a University hospital in Wessex, United Kingdom. The outcome measure were patient demographics, clinical and oncological data, risk factors, pre and post operative events, tumour staging, surgical approach, multidisciplinary treatment and survival. Results: Between January 2004 and January 2011, 63 patients underwent surgery for thymic pathology (30 women and 33 men). Median age of the patients was 65 years (range, 19-85). Myasthenia gravis was associated with 26 patients (41%) while in 37 patients (59%), it was detected incidentally. Open thymectomy was performed on 32 (51%) patients while 28 (44%) patients had thoracoscopic approach either through left or right side of the chest incorporating three port sites. There were 3 (4.7%) conversion of thoracoscopy to sternotomy due to adhesion. The mean length of hospital stay after the surgery was 4.8 +/- 3.7 days. WHO histological staging subdivided the patients in to 7 Type A (18%), 12 AB (30%), 6 B1 (15%), 7 B2 (17%), and 8 B3 (20). Twenty-three (36%) patients who had a radiological diagnosis of thymoma were proven as other anterior mediastinal tumours on histology. Radiotherapy was used as an adjunct to surgical treatment in 82% of patients with stages II and III disease. The actuarial 3-year survival rate is 98%. Mixed cellular histological features was more commonly seen with stage I disease. Conclusions: Thymomas are slow growing tumours which can be often missed in the absence of symptoms. With the multidisciplinary approach, survival rate even in patients with invasive disease shows significant improvement. Our early experience indicates that different surgical approaches yielded comparable outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To describe a single-center experience on the surgical management of thymoma. Study Design: A retrospective study on 63 consecutive patients who had thymectomy for presumed thymoma over a 7-year period in a University hospital in the Wessex region, United Kingdom, was conducted. Outcome Measures: Age, sex, association of myasthenia gravis or paraneoplastic syndrome, surgical approach, extent of surgical resection, tumor size, histological features of the tumor, clinical staging of the thymoma and short- and long-term outcome after surgery. Results: The mean age of the patients was 62.8 years. There were 26 female and 27 male patients. Myasthenia gravis was associated with 26 patients while 27 patients were detected incidentally on CT chest. Thirty-two patients had thymectomy by sternotomy while 28 patients had thoracoscopic approach. There were three conversions of thoracoscopy to sternotomy due to technical difficulty. The average length of stay after the surgery was 4.8 days. According to WHO staging, 18 patients were Type A, 14 patients were Type AB, 9 patients were Type B1, 9 patients were Type B2, and 3 patients were Type B3. There were 10 other patients who presented with local symptoms and had a pre-surgery diagnosis of thymoma on CT Chest. However, they were histologically diagnosed as other anterior mediastinal tumors. Radiotherapy was used as an adjunct to surgical treatment in 84% of patients with stage II and III disease. The actuarial 3-year survival rate was 98%. Only one patient died of metastatic thymoma. Mixed cellular histological features were more commonly seen with stage I disease. Conclusions: Thymomas are slow-growing tumors which can be often missed in the absence of symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for prolonged survival even in patients with invasive disease. Complete resection of the tumor followed by adjunct radiotherapy has improved the survival rate significantly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to introduce the authors' surgical technique of bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (BVT) and to compare their early surgical results between BVT and transsternal extended thymectomy (T3-b thymectomy) for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: The records of 114 patients who underwent either BVT (n = 55) or T3-b thymectomy (n = 59) for MG were reviewed retrospectively between January 2006 and November 2009. RESULTS: No surgical mortality or major morbidity occurred in either group. There was no conversion to open thymectomy, and no statistical difference was found in operation time between the two groups (112.2 +/- 26.2 min for BVT vs. 130.7 +/- 27.3 min for T-3b; p = 0.908). The duration of the chest tube, the length of the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay, and the duration of opioid use for pain control were shorter in BVT group. The estimated blood loss and the total amount of drainage were greater in the T3-b thymectomy group. The specimen weights retrieved by BVT (72.5 +/- 61.6 g) were similar to those retrieved by T3-b thymectomy (74.1 +/- 38.2 g, p = 0.63) in nonthymomatous MG. CONCLUSIONS: The BVT was a safe procedure with a surgical extent and amount similar to those of T-3b thymectomy and less invasive for patients with MG. Long-term follow-up assessment and more extensive data are mandatory to verify the early surgical outcomes.

AB  - AIM: To assess the surgical outcome of myasthenia gravis (MG) following thymectomy and to determine the outcome predictors to such therapeutic approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of 80 consecutive thymectomies performed for MG over a 16-year period. RESULTS: There were 41 females and 39 males (mean age, 34.32 years) with mean disease duration of 17.45 months prior to surgery. Stagewise distribution of the patients revealed 2.5% in stage I, 48.7% in stage IIA, 33.8% in stage IIB, 8.7% in stage III, and 6.3% in stage IV. The surgical approach was either trans-sternal (n=67) or video-assisted thoracoscopic route (n=13). Follow-up was obtained in 91.2% (n=73) of patients with mean duration of 67.7 months. At their last follow-up, 26.0% were in complete remission, 35.6% were asymptomatic on decreased medications, and 17.8% had clinical improvement on decreased medications. Overall, 79.4% of patients benefited from surgery, 8.2% had unchanged disease status, and 12.3% worsened clinically. Factors influencing favorable outcome include sex, disease stage, gland weight, and preoperative medication with anti-cholinesterase (P<0.05). There was one death in the perioperative period due to septicemia. Two patients died at fourth and seventh month following thymectomy. CONCLUSION: Thymectomy for MG is safe and effective. Certain influencing factors may shape treatment decisions and target higher risk patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the efficacy of a right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (RtVATET) as a surgical alternative for myasthenia gravis (MG) and to determine the optimal timing for a thymectomy. METHODS: Thirty-three patients who underwent RtVATET in two institutes were enrolled in this study. Another 66 paired, traditional trans-sternal extended thymectomy (TET) patients from the registered database were used to compare these two surgical modalities for MG. RESULTS: Mean blood loss was 88.5 ml in RtVATET and 226.8 ml in TET group patients (P < 0.001). Mean operation duration was 207.3 min for RtVATET and 172.8 min for TET patients (P = 0.003). Complete stable remission (CSR) rates and total improvement rates for the RtVATET and TET patients were 42.4% vs 60.6% (P = 0.087) and 87.9% vs 90.1% (P = 0.637), respectively. Furthermore, when we focused on the minor grades (classes I and IIa), TET groups showed significantly better CSR than the RtVATET groups (P = 0.012), but there was no statistically significant difference for the more severe grades (classes IIb and III, P = 0.827). CONCLUSION: Both RtVATET and TET are effective for treating MG, although this study does indicate an advantage for TET. We suggest that a thymectomy should therefore be performed earlier, or that the procedures should be extensive enough to remove all of the tissue that contains thymic tissue.

AB  - Introduction: the tumors of thymus account for less than 1% of all neoplasms and the choice treatment is the surgery. Objectives: to know the type of surgical treatment and the magnitude of resection, as well as the relationship with the tumor size, bleeding, surgical time and morbidity and mortality. Methods: a prospective study was conducted in 20 patients presenting with mediastinum tumor with surgery criteria over the admission in the services of neurology or general surgery of the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical Surgical Hospital from January, 2007 to February, 2009. Results are showed in percentages and variables relation Chi2 was the test used. Results: twelve patients were of female sex (54.5%). The more applied treatment was the total sternotomy in 9 patients (40.9%), surgical time varied from 50 to 260 min with a mean of 127.5, whereas the bleeding over of 100 mL was associated with a surgical time from 61 to 180 min (p= 0.036). Eleven patients have complications (50%) with a death (4.5%). The tumor size varied from 3.5 to 20 cm. The patients with neuroendocrine tumor have a relapse at 10 months, whereas in patients with thymoma until now there was neither relapse nor metastatic activity. Conclusion: surgery is the more important step in the treatment of mediastinum tumors and in most of them it is possible a total resection despite its size and the relationship with neighbouring structures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyse the effectiveness of treatment of myasthenia gravis with three different techniques of thymectomy. METHODS: Results of complete remission rates after 5-year follow-up of 60 patients who underwent basic transsternal thymectomies (group A) from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1997, 75 patients who underwent extended transsternal thymectomies (group B) from 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2000 and 291 patients who underwent transcervical-subxiphoid-videothoracoscopic 'maximal' thymectomy (group C) from 1 September 2000 to 31 January 2009 were compared. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups according to patient's characteristics and postoperative complications' rate. Ectopic foci of the thymic tissue were discovered in the fat of the neck and the mediastinum in 53.9% of patients from the group B and in 65.9% patients from the group C. After 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of follow-up, complete remission rates were 8.3%, 11.7%, 15.0%, 16.7% and 20.0%, respectively, in group A; 26.7%, 38.7%, 42.7%, 46.7% and 50.7%, respectively, in group B; and 31.5%, 39%, 45.8%, 46.3% and 53.1%, respectively, in group C. The differences between group A and the groups B and C after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were statistically significant. There were no significant differences between groups B and C. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The results of complete remission rates after 5-year follow-up were statistically better in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), who were operated on with extended transsternal thymectomy and transcervical-subxiphoid-videothoracoscopic 'maximal' thymectomy than the patients who underwent basic transsternal thymectomy. (2) The difference can be explained by the removal of ectopic foci of the thymic tissue from the neck and the mediastinum in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most thymectomies are performed via sternotomy. Minimally invasive thymectomy (MIT) has been described but its potential benefits and drawbacks remain unclear. METHODS: A retrospective chart review comparing thymectomies performed via sternotomy to MIT at a single institution between 2005 and 2009. RESULTS: Eight patients underwent MIT and 8 patients underwent sternotomy in the management of myasthenia gravis, thymic hyperplasia, or small thymic tumors. There was 1 perioperative death unrelated to the surgical procedure and no morbidity. The surgical time, estimated blood loss, and chest tube output was similar in both groups. The average hospital stay for MIT was 2.4 days compared with 4.3 days for sternotomy. One MIT patient remained on narcotic pain medication 2 weeks after surgery compared with 6 in the open group. CONCLUSIONS: MIT can be performed with similar morbidity and efficacy as transsternal thymectomy. Patients require fewer narcotics and can be discharged earlier.

AB  - Objective: To discuss the application and effectiveness of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: A retrospective review of 34 MG patients who received VATS extended thymectomy from September 2007 to September 2009 (VATS group) was undertaken, and compared with 27 MG patients who received trans-sternal (TS) thymectomy from November 2005 to May 2008 (TS group). The operation time, blood loss quantity, analgesic pethidine dose, hospitalization time, complication, incidence of MG crisis of the two groups were analyzed and the climical improvement was compared. Results: 34 cases of VATS group successfully received thymectomy and anterior mediastinal fat dissection. There were no operative complications and death cases. One case of MG Grisis was reported (2. 94%). When VATS group was compared with TS group, the blood loss quantity (102.64 mL+/-65.51 mL vs 187.40 mL+/-68.08 mL), the probability of postoperative complications (0.00% vs 11.76%), the postoperative analgesic pethidine dose (19.11 mg+/-30.19 mg vs 62.96 mg+/-77.94 mg) and the postoperative hospitalization time (9.64 d+/-5.53 d vs 13.89 d+/-6.75 d) were decreased, there were significant differences between two groups (P<0.05). The patients in VATS group were followed up 6 to 28 months (mean 12.7 months). Overall clinical improvement at follow-up was observed in 28 of 33 (84.85%) patients, with 9 of 33 (14.0%) patients in complete stable remission (CSR), compared with TS group (84.64%, 23.08%) there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion: VATS extended thymectomy is safe and effective, which is more advantageous for MG patients because of less tissue injury, lighter pain, lower incidence of complication, shorter hospitalization time, better cosmetic result and equivalent CSR rate.

AB  - We examined transversely the thymus of 33 myasthenia gravis (MG) patients followed up for more than 5 years and found three thymomas. One was found 21 years after thymoma resection (Masaoka I, WHO Type B2 thymoma) and extended thymectomy. The other two were non-thymomatous at onset, and they were not treated with extended thymectomy. Therapeutic guidelines should mention the importance of follow-up in MG thymus.

AB  - Introduction: Both transsternal and Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approaches are used for thymectomy in Myasthenia Gravis(MG). Recently, VATS may allow a minimally invasive alternative to the transternal approach. We compared outcomes of VATS and transsternal thymectomy in patients with MG. Methods: January 1996 and December 2008, 74 thymectomies were performed for MG.; 31 by VATS and 43 by transsternal apporoach. During VATS thymectomy, all patients were placed in 30 degree left lateral decubitus position under double-lumen intubated anesthesia. Usually threeport approach were used. Preoperative Osserman's classification and postoperative disease status were compared between the groups. Results: Mean age was 38.4+/-14.3(VATS) versus 36.9+/-13.7 years(transsteranl). Preoperative duration of MG was 13+/-21 versus 11+/-27 months, respectively. Preoperative Osserman's classification revealed the following: class I; 7(23%), 8(19%), IIA; 11(36%), 18(42%), IIB; 9(29%), 13(30%), III; 4(12%), 3(7%), IV; 0(0%), 1(2%), respectively. The operative time, the need for postoperative ventilator, The amount of chest tube were not difference between both group. The mean length of stay and the use of analgesics were better results in VATS group(p<0.05). Thymoma were found in 11.6% of the VATS and 13.6% of transsternal group(p=0.29). There were no surgical mortality cases. The mean follow up period was 3.9+/-4.3years(VATS) and 5.8+/-4.6years(transsternal). Complete remission without any medication after surgery was 18% and 19%; Partial remission after surgery was 45% and 49%. Conclusion: Thymectomy is an effective treatment in patients with MG with equivalent clinical outcomes obtained by either approach. However VATS has several advantages over transsternal open approach; shortens hospital stay and gives better cosmetic results.

AB  - Objective: The operative treatment of most cases of mediastinal tumors is part of a multimodal therapy. In many clinics, median sternotomy is still the method of choice for tumors of the anterior mediastinum especially for thymoma. However, there is an increasing tendency towards thoracoscopic methods. There is no data available for the adequate surgical procedure for thymoma. Methods: A prospective study analyzed 100 cases of conventional (median sternotomy) and thoracoscopic thymectomy for thymoma. The thoracoscopic operation was a standard unilateral 3-trocar left-sided technique with or without the da Vinci robotic system. Patients with stage I-II Masaoka classification were included in our study. All patients were analyzed for survival rate and tumor recurrence. The morbidity of both procedures was compared. For patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), we analyzed the stabile remission according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification. Furthermore, the worldwide development of minimally invasive thymectomy for thymic tumors was studied. Results: 100 thymic tumors were surgically treated between 01/1983 and 11/2009. After exclusion of patients with thymic carcinoma, thymic teratoma and thymoma stages III-IV, 30 patients with thymoma stage I-II Masaoka classification were analyzed. 74 patients were eliminated for a minimally invasive procedure after single patient analyses. Therefore, we could compare 30 cases of thoracoscopic thymectomy with 44 cases of thymectomy through a median sternotomy. There was no difference in the cumulative survival rate, tumor recurrence and complete remission for MG (Kaplan/ Meier). The decision for the optimal surgical procedure for thymoma is dependent on: symptoms, anatomical location, size, comorbidity, radiological diagnostic, surgical school and experience of the surgeon. Conclusions: The application of a thoracoscopic technique for thymic tumors is dependent on the surgeon experience and the rights and rules more than high evidence data. The first analysis and further observational studies of thoracoscopic thymectomy with correct patient choice show no disadvantage but rather patient based advantages.

AB  - Introduction: Approximately 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) will suffer from a myasthenic crisis during the course of their disease.<sup>1</sup> The prognosis of myasthenic crises has declined in the last 50 years from 40% to 5%.2 We present a 10-years retrospective review of patients with myasthenic crisis admitted to a neurologic intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Patients with myasthenic crisis admitted to our neurologic ICU between 2000 and 2009 were identified from the ICU register; case notes for all these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Forty-four patients were admitted in myasthenic crisis during this period; 5 had multiple admissions. The mean age at admission was 55.5 years; 29 patients were female. Mean duration of MG at ICU admission was 2.6 years. About 84% of patients were acetylcholine receptor antibody positive, 9% were positive for anti-MuSK antibodies, and 7% were seronegative. About 30% of the patients had had a previous thymectomy. In all cases, ICU admission was required because of respiratory failure, with 68% requiring mechanical ventilation (mean duration 16 d). Infection was identified as the precipitating cause in 15 cases (35%). About 80% of patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and 11% received plasma exchange. The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.5 days. There were 3 deaths (7% mortality rate), all due to sepsis. Conclusions: Myasthenic crisis is a serious complication of MG and is associated with significant mortality. Sepsis remains a potent precipitant of respiratory failure in MG and contributes to the mortality of such patients. The 7% mortality in this series may reflect the referral patterns of complex patients to a specialist neuromedical ICU.

AB  - Introduction: Thymectomy occupies one of the leading places in pathogenetic well-founded complex treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis. The majority of the domestic and foreign centres which are engaged in surgical treatment of myasthenia gravis, consider median sternotomy for thymectomy as the "gold" standard. However due to high trauma the given operation is not suitable for modern criteria of quality of the surgical help. New technologies have expanded possibilities of operative treatment and have changed sights of view in techniques of thymectomy. Aim: To compare surgical results after videothoracoscopic thymectomy and thymectomy via median sternotomy. Material s and methods: From January 2004 to December 2009 37 (50,7%) patients with generalized myasthenia gravis underwent videothoracoscopic thymectomy. The control group included 36 (49.3%) patients with generalized myasthenia gravis who underwent thymectomy via median sternotomy. Of the 73 patients, 57 were women (78,0%), 16 were men (22,0%). Mean age was 32+/-11,2 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding preoperative data. Results: Despite high clinical efficiency of operations in both groups, patients who underwent minimally invasive thymectomy had less risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The cosmetic effect was excellent in videothoracoscopic thymectomy group. Co n cl us i o n: Videothoracoscopic thymectomy is methodologicaly proved and it is an option of choice in surgical treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of thoracoscopic thymectomy for the treatment of Masaoka stage I and II thymoma. METHODS: We evaluated the short-term outcomes of 40 patients undergoing surgery for Masaoka stage I and II thymomas without myasthenia gravis between July 2000 and July 2008. Of these, 22 patients underwent complete thymoma resection using unilateral thoracoscopic subtotal thymectomy (UTST group), and 18 patients underwent trans-sternal thymectomy (TST group). RESULTS: Intra-operative blood loss amounts did not differ significantly between the UTST and TST groups (100.6 ml and 208.1 ml, respectively, p=0.0513). The duration of the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shortened in the UTST group (4.6 days vs 11.2 days, p<0.0001). No patient in the UTST group underwent conversion to open surgery. No severe surgical complications, such as bleeding due to injury to the left brachiocephalic vein, and no postoperative complications, were detected in this series. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that thoracoscopic thymectomy for Masaoka stage I and II thymoma is technically feasible and safe, and it is less invasive for the patient. Nevertheless, this procedure requires further investigation in a large series with a longer follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While thymectomy is an accepted treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG), video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) thymectomy has recently become a popular surgical treatment, especially for non-thymomatous MG (NTMG). This study aims to compare the results of VATS thymectomy and trans-sternal thymectomy, and identify prognostic factors in NTMG patients after thymectomy. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective review (January 1995 to December 2004) of 60 consecutive thymectomies (22 trans-sternal thymectomies and 38 VATS thymectomies) of NTMG patients performed in a university teaching hospital was undertaken. RESULTS: There were 43 female patients and 17 male patients with a median MG-onset age of 25 years (range: 5-78 years). Median follow-up time was 44 months. VATS thymectomy patients had a shorter hospital stay than the trans-sternal thymectomy patients (5.6 days vs 8.1 days, p=0.008). There was no other statistically significant difference between the two operative methods in NTMG patients, including intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator support time, operative time, postoperative status, complete stable remission (CSR) rate, morbidity and mortality. Three prognostic factors associated with better remission rate were hyperthyroidism (p=0.003), age <40 years (p=0.022) and the presence of thymic hyperplasia (p=0.041). Other factors, including gender, disease duration, preoperative MG severity, acetylcholine receptor antibody, perioperative therapy and operative methods (32% vs 36%, p=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.27-3.21) were not statistically relevant to better remission rate. CONCLUSIONS: VATS thymectomy is more advantageous for NTMG patients because of shorter hospital stay, less tissue injury, better cosmetic result and equivalent CSR rate. NTMG patients aged <40 years with hyperthyroidism and a histologic diagnosis of lymphofollicular hyperplasia have better chances of remission after thymectomy.

AB  - Improved histological typing systems for thymic tumors and advances in induction and adjuvant therapy have created the need to reevaluate strategies for the management of thymoma. We retrospectively studied 73 patients with completely resected thymomas unassociated with myasthenia gravis. The World Health Organization (WHO) histologic classification, clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Overall survival was 66.2% at 10 years, and the median survival time was 169 months. According to the Masaoka staging system, overall survival rates at 10 years were 94.7% in stage I, 76.1% in stage II, 30% in stage III and 0% in stage IV. In the WHO classification, overall survival rates at 10 years were 91.9% in types A and AB, 50.9% in type B2 and not achieved in type B3. The disease-free interval was slightly shorter in patients with B2 and B3 disease than in those with type A, AB and B1 disease. Advanced thymomas were significantly associated with type B2 and B3 (p<0.01). In stage III and IV disease, adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy was associated with better survival as compared to no adjuvant therapy (p=0.07). On multivariate analysis, Masaoka stage III and IV disease and extended thymectomy indicated significant, negative and independent risk factors for survival (p<0.01). Masaoka stage I and II thymomas or WHO type A and AB thymomas have favorable prognoses and do not require postoperative adjuvant therapy. Patients with stage III and IV thymomas require additional therapy after surgery.

AB  - Objective: Complete thymectomy is necessary for all cases of thymoma and for almost all patients with myasthenia gravis. The radicality of minimally invasive techniques is comparable with that of conventional surgery. The introduction of robotic-assisted surgery has offered a refinement of the minimally invasive procedures. In this study, the technique of robotic thymectomy with the da Vinci robotic system is presented. Methods: The patient is placed in a right 30-degree antidecubitus position. The da Vinci trocars are placed between the 2nd and 5th intercostal spaces in the submammary fold. The placement of the camera trocar allows for so-called thoraco-lift, which together with the CO2-insufflation provides an enlargement of the entire operation field. The pericardial fatty tissue along the left phrenic nerve is mobilized. The cervical compartment is opened at the cranial mediastinal pleural fold. The innominate vein and the thymic veins are localized. Dissection of the aorto-caval groove mobilizes the right thymic portion with the surrounding tissue. The cervical upper thymic poles are easily dissected with the da Vinci endo-wrist instruments. Results: In a prospective study, 178 robotic thoracoscopic thymectomies were performed. The technique was standardized in 10 steps. 31 patients with thymoma and 155 patients with myasthenia gravis were operated on. Median operative time was 165 minutes (range 90-420). There were 3 conversions. After a median follow-up of 29 months (range 1-72), there were no recurrent thymomas but adequate improvement of the symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Conclusions: The dexterity of tissue dissection is improved with the da Vinci robotic system. Due to the inherent technical advantages, the approach of robotic thymectomy combines the requirements of minimally invasive techniques and radical dissection for thymectomy.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to compare effectiveness of transsternal and thoracoscopic thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Material and methods: Between May 2002 and May 2005, a randomised prospective trial was performed. The trial included 50 myasthenia gravis patients treated by thymectomy. 28 patients underwent right side extended thoracoscopic thymectomy with neck incision and 22 patients - extended transsternal thymectomy. The results of these two methods were compared using statistical methods. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classifications were used to assess preoperation disease severity and results of surgical treatment. Results: There were 36 (72%) women and 14 (28%) men includedin the study. Mean age was 33 years (range from 16 to 71). Mean follow up was 9.3 months (range from 1 to 36). There was 24% (12 patients) postoperative morbidity and no mortality. There was no significant difference in both groups regarding postoperative morbidity. In the sternotomy group there was 95% (21 patients) improvement rate and none of the patients achieved complete stable remission. In the thoracoscopy group there was 64% (18 patients) improvement rate and 4% (1 patient) complete stable remission rate. The rate of positive results (complete stable remission or improvement) was higher in the sternotomy group and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.029). Conclusions: Although the study showed better results after transsternal thymectomy, a short period of follow up does not allow for definitive assessment of the methods being compared. A limited time of follow up and very strict criteria of the postintervention status evaluation recommended by MGFA and used in this trial seem to be the main reason for the low complete stable remission rate obtained in the presented series.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis(MG). METHODS: Sixty-two MG cases underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy. The operative extension included thymus tissue and adipose tissue in anterior superior mediastinum. RESULTS: All operations were performed successfully. The mean operating duration, mean intraoperative blood loss and mean postoperative hospital stay was 98 +/- 26 minutes, 60 +/- 29 ml and 8.2 +/- 2.5 days respectively. All cases were followed up for 5 to 48 months. Among them, 20 (32.3%) patients achieved a complete relief, 32 (51.6%) had their improved symptoms, 8 (12.9%) remained stable and 2 (3.2%) became worse. And the overall relief rate was 83.9%. CONCLUSION: Video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy is both feasible and reliable for MG with the advantages of a minimal trauma and a rapid recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic effects of video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) and transsternal extended thymectomy (TET) for myasthenia gravis (MG). METHOD: This study included 21 patients undergoing VATET through the "three holes" approach on the right chest and 32 undergoing TET with sternum dissection. The thymus was excised and the anterior mediastinum adipose tissue removed in both groups. RESULTS: VATET was associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and longer operative time without the use of postoperative analgesics; very few patients were admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU), showing significant differences from the TET group (P<0.05). No significant difference was found between the two groups in tracheal tube removal time, length of stay in ICU, closed thoracic drainage removal time, and postoperative hospital stay, total hospital stay, postoperative complications, total hospitalization costs, or the rate of remission and improvement (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TET, VATET requires only a small incision without leaving metal foreign body in the body, and the patients experience less postoperative pain and rapid recovery, with similar mid- and long-term clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Analysis of effectiveness of treatment of myasthenia gravis with three different techniques of thymectomy. Methods: Results of complete remission rates after five years follow-up of 60 patients who underwent basic transsternal thymectomies (group A) from 1 November 1996 to 31 December 1997, 75 patients who underwent extended transsternal thymectomies (group B) from 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2000 and 301 patients who underwent transcervical-subxiphoid-videothoracoscopic 'maximal' thymectomy (group C) from 1 September 2000 to 31 January 2009 were compared. Results: There were no differences between groups according to patient's characteristics and postoperative complications rate. Ectopic foci of the thymic tissue were discovered in the fat of the neck and the mediastinum in 50.7% of patients from the group B and in 62% patients from the group C. After 1-5 years of follow-up complete remission rates were 8.3%, 11.7%, 15.0%, 16.7% and 20.0%, respectively in the group A, 29.3%, 37.9%, 41.4%, 46.6% and 51.2%, respectively in the group B and 26.3%, 36.5%, 42.9%, 46.8% and 50.2%, respectively in the group C. The differences between group A and the groups B and C after 1-5 years were statistically significant. There were no significant differences between groups B and C. Conclusions: 1. The results of complete remission rates after 5-year follow-up were statistically better in patients with MG who were perated on with extended transsternal thymectomy and transcervical-subxiphoidvideothoracoscopic 'maximal' thymectomy in comparison to the patients who underwent basic transsternal thymectomy. 2. The difference can be explained by the removal of ectopic foci of the thymic tissue from the neck and the mediastinum in these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate different characteristics of the video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) versus transsternal thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: The clinical data of 106 patients who underwent VATS thymectomy for MG between February 2002 and May 2007, and 108 patients who underwent transsternal thymectomy between March 1998 and August 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. In VATS group, there were 64 male and 42 female patients, and the mean age was 38-years-old. In the transsternal group, 68 patients were male and 40 were female, and the mean age was 36-years-old. Analysis of conditions related to the surgical procedure between two groups was made, such as length of surgery, operative bleeding, postoperative drainage, hospital stay, hospitalization expenses and complications. The mean time of follow-up was 38.5 months (ranging from 10 to 67 months). All patients were classified according to the MGFA clinical classification. RESULTS: Intraoperative bleeding in VATS group was (34 +/- 5) ml, significantly less than (150 +/- 23) ml in the transsternal group. Postoperative drainage in VATS group was (42 +/- 18) ml, significantly less than (168 +/- 31) ml in the transsternal group. Complications and hospital stay in VATS group were also significantly lower than those in the transsternal group. There was no significantly different in the long-term outcome between two groups. CONCLUSION: Although both thoracoscopic and transsternal approaches to thymectomy in patients with MG are effective after the long-term follow-up, VATS thymectomy has its specific advantages of minimal invasion, less complications, and rapid recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perioperative management and video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: A total of 102 patients who received extended thymectomy for MG from June 2000 to August 2007 were divided into 2 groups by operative approach: 51 in the VATS group and 51 in the full median sternotomy group. The clinical features, including operation time, operation blood loss, post-operative drainage, incidence of crisis, hospital stay, and the 1-year total effective rate after the operation were compared. Complications were treated exactly and cholinesterase inhibitors were applied to control the symptom of MG before the operation. The whole thoracic gland and fat in the anterior mediastinum were removed. Steroid, cholinesterase inhibitors and plasmapheresis were used to prevent and cure myasthenic crisis after the operation. RESULTS: No patients died in the operation and hospitalization. There was no significant difference in the operation time [(128.14+/-34.82) min vs. (130.46+/-28.71) min] and the 1-year total effective rate after the operation (85.8% vs. 87.2%)in the 2 groups (P>0.05). The operation blood loss, postoperative drainage, incidence of crisis, and postoperative hospital stay in the median sternotomy group were higher or longer than those in the VATS group [(93.77+/-21.64) mL vs. (45.42+/-10.96) mL,P<0.05; (174.65+/-21.64) mL vs. (101.33+/-28.76) mL, P<0.01;7.84% vs. 1.96%, P<0.05; (14.23+/-3.17) d vs. (8.37+/-1.18) d, P<0.05)]. CONCLUSION: VATS extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis is safe, less invasive and effective. Preoperative preparation and the perioperative management can decrease the incidence of crisis. The plasmapheresis is the key of curing myasthenic crisis.

AB  - Minimally invasive thymectomy procedures have been proposed for nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis. However, few reports stressed that the lower invasiveness or cosmetic benefits also evaluated the rationale of a thymectomy, which is performed to remove as much thymic tissue as possible. We retrospectively reviewed 30 consecutive patients who underwent a bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) and compared the results with those of 26 patients who underwent a transsternal extended thymectomy (TSET) to determine the amount of removed thymic tissue and clinical prognosis. The amount of blood loss during the operation for VATET (median 60 mL; range nearly 0 to 940 mL) was significantly lower as compared with that of TSET. The median weight of removed thymic tissue (37.0 g; 18.3 to 100.0 g) and remission rates (1 y: 12.5%; 3 y: 30.8%; 4 y: 44.4%) of VATET were comparable with those of TSET. The VATET group had a similar amount of thymo-fatty tissue removed and feasible clinical outcomes as compared with the TSET group, indicating that VATET provides a proper balance between less invasiveness and radical capability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic thymectomy is commonly used for treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients due to its relatively low invasiveness. However, the long-term effects of endoscopic thymectomy have not been fully evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effects of extended infrasternal mediastinoscopic thymectomy (IMT) in MG patients and compare them with those of extended transsternal thymectomy (TT). METHODS: Among 24 MG patients without thymoma who underwent thymectomy in our Institute between January 1997 and December 2000, 14 patients who received IMT and 10 who received TT were enrolled in the present study. Quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (anti-AChR) titers were evaluated before and at five years after surgery. RESULTS: After five years, QMG scores were reduced from 6.6 to 1.8 (p<0.01) in the IMT group, and from 7.6 to 2.7 (p<0.01) in the TT group. The anti-AChR titers were reduced from 75.2 to 40.1 (p=0.027) in the IMT group, and from 224 to 61.3 (p=0.020) in the TT group. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the long-term therapeutic effect of IMT is equivalent to TT, and is thus suitable for the treatment of MG patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both transsternal and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approaches are used for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. We compared outcomes of simultaneous experiences in two institutions: one utilizing the transsternal approach exclusively, the other using VATS procedures for all patients. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America guidelines were used to standardize reporting. METHODS: Between March 1992 and September 2006, 95 thymectomies were performed for myasthenia gravis; 48 by VATS and 47 by transsternal approach. Preoperative classification and postoperative disease status were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Mean age was 39.8 +/- 14.9 (VATS) versus 34.4 +/- 13.2 years (transsternal) (p = 0.07); the proportion of females was 52% versus 67% (p = 0.15); and preoperative duration of myasthenia gravis was 27 +/- 44 versus 20 +/- 45 months (p = 0.43), respectively. Clinical follow up was 89.5% complete at a mean of 6.0 +/- 4.0 years and 4.3 +/- 2.9 years (p = 0.03). The operative time was 128 +/- 34 minutes (VATS) versus 119 +/- 27 minutes (transsternal) (p = 0.22). The need for postoperative ventilation was 4.2% versus 16.2% (p = 0.07) and mean length of stay was 1.9 +/- 2.6 versus 4.6 +/- 4.2 days (p < 0.001). Thymomas were found in 8.3% of VATS versus 13.3% of transsternal patients (p = 0.44). No myasthenia gravis related deaths occurred and 95.8% of the VATS and 97.9% of the transsternal patients were in either complete stable remission, pharmacologic remission, or minimal manifestations status. In the VATS group, 13 of 17 (76.5%) patients stopped prednisone usage after surgery versus 5 of 14 (35.7%) in the transsternal group (p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy is an effective treatment in patients with myasthenia gravis with equivalent clinical outcomes obtained by either approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical outcome of 180 non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) consecutive cases surgically treated is reported herein. The original surgical access, consisting of a video-assisted infra-mammary cosmetic incision and median sternotomy, has originally been designed and described by our group. METHODS: The in-hospital patients' charts and the outpatients' clinic follow-up information of the 180 cases have been extensively reviewed. In addition to the strictly surgical benchmark referral, data on the rate of cure of the MG (complete stable remission - CSR; pharmacological remission - PR) as indicated by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) have been analysed as recorded at the 12 months after surgery checkpoint. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated as well. RESULTS: Female to male ratio was 156 (86.7%):24 (13.3%). Mean age: 29.1+/-10.9 years. Preoperative MGFA score: stage I: 4 patients (2.2%); IIa: 57 (31.7%); IIb: 32 (17.8%); IIIa: 41 (23.3%); IIIb: 42 (23.3%); IVa: 2 (1.1%); V: 2 (1.1%). Median operative time was 110 min (70-130 min) and median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (3-10 days). Postoperative mortality was nil and morbidity occurred in seven patients (3.8%). Final pathology was consistent with: 146 hyperplastic thymus (81.1%); 28 involuted thymus (15.6%) and 6 normal thymus (3.3%). Ectopic thymic tissue was found in 68% of the patients. Mean follow-up was 62.9+/-34.6 months. A CSR was obtained in 55%; PR in 18.3%; improvement in 39.9%, unchanged in 3.5%, worse in 1.1% and died in 0.5%. Kaplan-Meier estimates of CSR were 34.1% and 75.8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The preoperative therapy was the only parameter significantly associated with Kaplan-Meier CSR rates (univariate analysis - p<0.001). Remarkably, 171 (95%) patients judged their cosmetic results to be excellent or very good. CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy in MG patients via video-assisted infra-mammary cosmetic incision and median sternotomy has shown to be a useful surgical approach as demonstrated by the good functional and very good aesthetic results, associated with a very low morbidity and no mortality. Patients with preoperative mono-therapy have higher CSR rates. CSRs are durable, as the CSR rate improves with extended follow-up.

AB  - Background: Our increasing experience with VAT thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG) has encouraged us to extend this treatment to early stage thymomas and challenge conventional teaching. Methods: We have compared the first 15 consecutive patients (10 Male; 5 Female); median age 66 (range 40-81) years who underwent VAT thymoma excision (Group V) with 20 matched patients (11 Male; 9 Female), median age 59.5 (range 34-89) years who underwent open thymoma excision by sternotomy (Group O). VAT excision was performed via three 3 cm incisions using electrocautery to remove all mediastinal tissue. Peri-operative, histological and long-term oncological data were recorded. Follow-up was complete for all patients. Results: All patients had non-invasive tumours on preoperative CT staging; 4 patients in Group O and 5 patients in Group V had concomitant MG. There was no significant difference in tumour size (median; 7.5 cm in Group V vs. 10.0 cm in Group O, P=0.07), Masaoka stage or complete resection (R0) between groups. However, more patients in Group O underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. There was no significant difference in median operating time (115 min Group V vs. 120 min Group O) or duration of tube drainage (P=0.3) but Group V patients had significantly less volume of drainage; 150 ml vs. 593 ml (P<0.01) and shorter hospital stay. There was no in-hospital mortality in either group. During follow-up (mean 34.4 months) there were three deaths in Group O at 3, 24 and 76 months and one in Group V at 48 months. There was no difference in estimated tumour-specific 5-year survival or tumour recurrence between the groups. Conclusions: The use of videoassisted thoracoscopic resection for early stage thymoma is both feasible and safe, with shorter hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report is to discuss the appropriate choice of procedures for video-assisted resection of thymoma according to factors such as the presence of myasthenia gravis or location of the tumor. METHODS: We evaluated the short-term results of thoracoscopic surgery for 30 consecutive cases of noninvasive thymoma. Unilateral thoracoscopic partial (or subtotal) thymectomy (UTPT) was employed in patients with nonmyasthenic thymoma localized to the unilateral mediastinum, and extended (or total) thymectomy by an infrasternal mediastinal approach (ETIS) in myasthenic cases or those in which total thymectomy was considered inevitable. RESULTS: UTPT was performed on 11 nonmyasthenic patients, and ETIS on 19 (13 myasthenics and six nonmyasthenics). Three patients in the ETIS group underwent conversion to sternotomy because of pericardial dissemination, pleural adhesion, and vascular injury, respectively. The mean surgical duration was 163 min and 224 min and mean blood loss was 123 g versus 149 g for UTPT and ETIS, respectively. Post-thymomectomy myasthenia occurred in a patient after UTPT who made an excellent recovery to remission after the re-UTPT. There has not been any recurrence detected for 48 months of mean postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial regarding the choice of total or partial thymectomy in thoracoscopic surgery for thymomas yielded acceptable results that warrant further investigations into long-term survival and recurrence after longer-term observation of patients undergoing these procedures.

AB  - We studied 197 patients with thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis (T-MG) to identify variables that can influence the natural history of the disease and the therapeutical approaches. Multivariate analysis showed that neither clinical nor pathological variables were associated with a better chance to reach complete stable remission. The video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) was not significantly correlated with a lower chance of achieving complete stable remission compared with the classical transsternal approach (T-3b) (p=0.1090). Thymoma recurrence was not correlated with surgery by VATET or T-3b. VATET was safe and reliable for removal of thymoma. The low chance of achieving remission (9.64%) in T-MG underlines the importance of an early diagnosis as well as the need for more aggressive therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease with a great impact on quality of life. Besides conservative treatment with mestinon and immunosuppressive medication, thymectomy is an established intervention that offers substantial improvements of the disease. Since the past decade, minimally invasive procedures have been performed. This study aimed to report on the long-term results for all the patients who underwent thymectomy for myasthenia gravis, paying special attention to postoperative disease-related outcome, quality of life, and differences regarding the operative approach. METHODS: This report describes a series of 131 patients with generalized myasthenia gravis who underwent thymectomy between 1980 and 2005. The clinical course data during the hospitalization and consultation in our outpatient clinic were reviewed, and survival data were generated. The patients were seen in the outpatient clinic, where a modified Osserman and quality-of-life score was evaluated at the end of the follow-up period for all surviving patients. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with myasthenia gravis were followed up after thymectomy for a median time of 8 years (range, 1-27 years). Eight patients died during this period. The perioperative mortality rate was 0%, and the morbidity rate was 19.8%. The patients with thymoma and a high preoperative Osserman score had a significantly shorter survival. With minimally invasive procedures, the hospital stay was significantly shorter, and the rate for improvement of myasthenia gravis-associated symptoms was significantly higher. The rate of perioperative complications and myasthenia-related complications during the follow-up period showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Transsternal and minimally invasive thymectomy contribute to an improvement in myasthenia gravis symptoms for all subgroups. Surgery can be performed with low individual risks. In our trial, minimally invasive surgery was found to be superior in terms of improvement in myasthenia gravis-associated symptoms. Additionally, the hospital stay was shorter, and the patients felt less disturbed by direct effects of the operation. Therefore, minimally invasive thymectomy can be regarded as the treatment of choice for patients undergoing surgery for myasthenia gravis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mid-, and long-term effects of video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy and transsternal thymectomy in treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) and to identify the prognostic factors for thymectomy success. METHODS: 161 patients with non-thymomatous MS, 84 males and 120 females, aged 33, underwent transsternal thymectomy and were followed up for 5 years; and 43 patients with non-thymomatous MS A retrospective, 1 male and 25 females, 21 being aged >40 during operation, underwent thoracoscopic thymectomy and were followed up for 3 years. RESULTS: The mean operating time of the thoracoscopic group was (132 +/- 32) min minutes, significantly longer than that of the transsternal thymectomy group [(96 +/- 18) min, P = 0.000]. Four patients in the transsternal thymectomy group and 41 in the transsternal thymectomy group developed myasthenic crises (P = 0.023). The complete stable remission (CSR) rates 1, 2, and 3 years after operation of the thoracoscopic thymectomy group were 34.9%, 41.9%, and 46.5% respectively; and CSR rates 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after operation of the transsternal thymectomy group were 26.7%, 31.7%, 35.4%, and 40.4% respectively, without significant differences between these 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Both thoracoscopic and transsternal approaches to thymectomy in patients with MG are effective in terms of remission. The authors advocate adopting the thoracoscopic approach early.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy represents a safe and valid approach for patients with myasthenia gravis. However, some factors may influence the efficacy of thymectomy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of generalized myasthenia gravis with oropharyngeal involvement and compare the postoperative outcome of generalized myasthenia gravis without and with oropharyngeal involvement. METHODS: From 1991 to 2002, there were 202 patients with nonthymomatous generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG), who underwent thymectomy by the transsternal approach or thoracoscopy. According to the clinical classification of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA), these patients have been subdivided into two groups: GMG without oropharyngeal involvement and GMG with oropharyngeal involvement. Complete stable remission, as defined by the MGFA Medical Task Force, was the primary endpoint for efficacy. RESULTS: In all, 182 patients were followed up for at least 5 years. There were 135 cases of GMG without oropharyngeal involvement and 47 cases of GMG with oropharyngeal involvement. There were significant differences in postoperative pneumonia, ventilatory support time, and myasthenic crisis between patients with GMG with and without oropharyngeal involvement (p values were 0.040, 0.021, and 0.007, respectively). At 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative probability of reaching complete stable remission in GMG without oropharyngeal involvement was 18.5% at the end of the first year, and rose steadily in subsequent years (26.7%, 37.0%, 39.1%, and 40% at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively). In GMG with oropharyngeal involvement, it was 6.4%, 14.9%, 23.4%, 29.9%, and 31.9%, respectively, in the continual follow-up years. The first 3 years were associated with a significantly greater probability of achieving complete stable remission (p = 0.047 for the first year, p = 0.025 for the second one, and p = 0.048 for the third one). The later 2 years had no significant difference on complete stable remission. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal myasthenia gravis is more severe and the prognosis after thymectomy is not as optimistic as for patients without oropharyngeal involvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The majority of patients show abnormal thymic histology. SETTING: The study was performed at the Myasthenia Gravis Centre, Karolinska University Hospital, and at the Immunological Research Laboratory, Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Information was collected retrospectively from 1956 and prospectively from 1975 on clinical data, concomitant diseases, concentration of serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-abs), immunosuppressive treatment (IS) and response to it, in 537 patients of whom 326 were thymectomised. Follow-up time was 1.5-50 years. RESULTS: Age at onset of MG increased from a median age of 24 years before 1975 to a median age of 61 years after 2000. Thymoma was found in 65, hyperplasia (HPL) in 185 and a normal thymus in 76 patients. The trans-sternal surgical approach for thymectomy was used in 255 patients (78%). In five patients with thymoma, MG appeared after thymectomy. Of 537 patients, 466 (87%) had circulating AChR-abs. IS was given to 300 (56%) patients, mostly those with thymoma (85%). In total, 441 patients (82%) showed an improvement. One-third of patients with HPL, a quarter of those with thymoma, one-fifth of those with a normal thymus and one-seventh of those not operated on went into remission. CONCLUSION: The prognosis for the majority of patients with MG is favourable, irrespective of thymic histology. The cause may be the use of immunomodulating therapy.

AB  - Thymectomy is one of the current management strategies for myasthenia gravis. This is observational study focused on the evolution of the surgical and anesthesiological strategies applied to the patients submitted to thymectomy initially by maximal sternotomy (in the years 1994-1998), followed by unconditioned reorientation towards thymectomy by VATS. A number of 103 patients are included, 51 thymectomy by left VATS. All the thoracoscopic thymectomy were performed in general anesthesia, the lungs were separated by left selective intubation, and the left lung was deflated during the surgical procedure. The surgical complications appeared mainly in the VATS group: one pericardial and one myocardial lesion leading to sternotomy (minimal blood loss, uneventful recovery), contralateral pleural lesion with pneumothorax. The classical approach accounted for one hemothorax. The postoperative mortality was zero in the VATS group vs. 6 out of 52 pts in the sternotomy group. The postoperative evolution confronted the anesthesiologist with the classical crises of myasthenia. Death occurred within the first three weeks following surgery. The demise in 3 cases was due to cardiac complications (preexisting cardiomyopathy complicated by ventricular arrhythmia) and respiratory failure plus sepsis (for the remaining cases that we lost). The treatment options in the ICU are discussed: plasmapheresis, immunosuppression, ventilatory support. VATS is appropriate for almost all thymectomy, but the outcome is heavily based on a team approach: neurologist, surgeon and anesthetist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the surgical approach on surgical and neurologic outcomes after extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the institutional extended thymectomies for myasthenia gravis within the last decade was performed. Patients of group A (open access by total median sternotomy; n=10; 1996-2002) and of group B (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach with the da Vinci robotic system; n=9; 2003-2006) did not differ with regard to gender distribution, age, body mass index, American Association of Anaesthetists score and Osserman classification of myasthenia gravis. Primary endpoints were surgical complications and the symptomatic/neurologic outcome of the extended thymectomy. Secondary endpoints were operating times and hospital stay. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 74+/-23 months in group A and 13+/-10 months in group B. Surgical complications occurred in 4 patients in group A (requiring 2 re-interventions) and in 1 patient in group B (p<0.05). The median dose of Pyridostigminbromid was reduced 3 and 6 months postoperatively in group A to 80% and 60% of the preoperative level and in group B to 66% and 60% of the preoperative level, respectively. Within the first postoperative year all patients of group B had an improvement of their disease whereas 2 patients of group A did not benefit from thymectomy or had a worsening of symptoms. Operating times were significantly shorter in group A (110 (42-152) min vs 154 (94-312) min, p<0.05), hospital stay was significantly shorter in group B (5 (4-15) vs 10 (10-23) days, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this small series favour the robotic approach for extended thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in respect of both surgical and early neurologic outcome. However, prospective randomized trials are required to prove a general validity.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if patients are in remission or weaning off medication after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG) and to examine the thoracoscopic versus open approaches. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent thymectomy for MG at a tertiary referral center between 1992 and 2004 (N = 14). Six patients (42.9%) underwent thoracoscopic resection. Eight patients underwent open resection; 5 (35.7%) had median sternotomy and 3 (21.4%) by transcervical approaches. Follow-up was obtained in 12 (85.7%) of 14 patients by both chart review and telephone. The mean follow-up was 43.0 months (range, 4-111 months). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or Fisher's Exact Test. RESULTS: The thoracoscopic group had a mean operating time of 138.8 minutes compared with 139.8 minutes in the open group (P = .9). The thoracoscopic group had a mean estimated blood loss of 7.5 mL compared with 52.5 mL in the open group (P = .02). The mean length of stay for the thoracoscopic group was 1.5 days (range, 1-2 days) and was 10.6 days (range, 3-41 days) in the open group (P = .13). Three (60%) of 5 patients were entirely off medication in the thoracoscopic group at the time of follow-up compared with 3 (50%) of 6 patients in the open group (P = 1.0). In the thoracoscopic group, 5 (83.3%) of 6 were in class 1 to 3 of the DeFilippi classification (complete remission or improved with decreased medication requirements). One patient had no change in symptoms (class 4). In the open group, 5 (83.3%) of 6 were classified as DeFilippi 1 to 3 at the time of follow-up, and one patient had worsening symptoms (class 5). CONCLUSIONS: Both thoracoscopic and open approaches to thymectomy in patients with MG are effective, with more than 80% of patients in both groups in remission or with improvement at the time of follow-up. The thoracoscopic group has the added benefits of decreased estimated blood loss, decreased length of hospital stay, and improved cosmesis. We advocate the thoracoscopic approach for thymectomy in the treatment of juvenile MG.

AB  - Aim. The objective is to study the impact of traditional and videoassisted thymectomy on the incidence of remission of patients with M.G. Methods. The general conditions of our patients were evaluated by means of a retrospective telephon questionnaire. 17 patients (12 female and 5 Males) referred for thymectomy between June 1994 and January 2002 were included in the analysis. Transternal and videotoracoscopic thymectomies were performed. Results. In the latter a minimal cervical incision is performed to withdraw the specimen that is dissected free through three bilateral thoracic trocars. Good results were achieved in 87.5% with complete (31%) and partial (56%) remission of symptoms. Conclusions. Minimally invasive thymectomies seem to give the same results than more invasive procedures and are associated with very little morbidity and very low complication rate; cosmetical results are excellent. Important favourable prognostic factors are young age and a short time between diagnosis and surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because evidence-based data regarding the quality of video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy for the treatment of myasthenia gravis are lacking, a prospective trial comparing three different operative approaches was conducted to evaluate their efficacy. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 20 consecutive patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis. A series of three approaches for bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) using the anterior chest wall-lifting method (original), the original method with a flexed-neck position (modified), and the original method with a transcervical approach (final) were prospectively performed in each patient for quantitative and pathologic evaluation of the residual thymus after each approach. RESULTS: Complete VATET required 242 +/- 48 min, with the transcervical procedure requiring 23 +/- 12 min. After the modified method, the residual thymus in the cervical region was 1.5 cm in size and weighed 0.8 g (0.8% of the entire thymus), as compared with a size of 2.2 cm and a weight of 1.3 g (3.2%) after the original method. Each value is the result of comparison with the final method. Histopathologic studies showed residual tissue in the germinal center as well as Hassall's corpuscles in more than 70% of cases. CONCLUSION: The findings show that VATET without the transcervical approach could be an immunologically incomplete treatment for myasthenia gravis. Therefore, the transcervical approach should be included in VATET procedures to ensure radicality.

AB  - The role of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) thymectomy is still being studied, and many surgeons remain skeptical of the value of this recent option. We made a retrospective evaluation to ascertain whether VATS-extended thymectomy is as reliable as standard median sternotomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) and whether the endoscopic procedure presents any advantages for patients. Eighteen consecutive patients requiring extended thymectomy for MG were treated between April 1997 and September 2003 at our hospital. Nine patients received VATS-extended thymectomy, and the remaining nine patients received standard extended thymectomy by sternotomy. In the VATS group, the anterior mediastinal space was well visualized by sternal lifting. The mean operative time was 268.3 +/- 51.1 minutes in the VATS group and 177.3 +/- 92.5 minutes in the sternotomy group. Operative time was significant longer in the VATS group than in the sternotomy group (P < 0.05). The mean operative bleeding was 68.6 +/- 47.8 ml in the VATS group and 154.1 +/- 109.0 ml in the sternotomy group. Operative bleeding was significantly less in the VATS group than in the sternotomy group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postoperative duration of chest tube or the level of serum C-reactive protein on the first operative day. There was a downward trend in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors antibody levels after thymectomy compared with before thymectomy in both groups. VATS thymectomy should be considered a valid alternative to the established approaches aimed at achieving a "curative thymectomy" in patients with MG.

AB  - A series of 151 thoracoscopic thymectomy performed in the Department of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation of the Fundeni Clinical Institute between April 1999 and April 2004 is analyzed. These were 89.34% from all the thymectomies performed in our department in this period. Thoracoscopic thymectomies were performed on 131 female patients (86.75%) and 20 male patients (23.25%), aged between 8 and 60 years. All patients were previously treated in the Neurological Department of the Fundeni Clinical Institute for at least 3 months. The thoracoscopic thymectomy was indicated for: myasthenia gravis without thymic neoplasia (141 cases), stage I Masaoka thymoma (8 cases), remnant postoperative thymic tissue (3 cases). We have used a left thoracoscopic approach in 73 cases and a right thoracoscopic approach in 76 cases. In 2 cases a mixed cervical and thoracoscopic approach was needed.. No mortality and morbidity 6.62% (10 cases). From this 151 patients 100 have been constantly followed for more then one year. From the other 51, 32 are in the first postoperative year, and the other 19, 12.58% have been lost in surveillance. The one year evaluation regarding the Research Standards of Myasthenia Gravis Task Force Foundation shows: improvement--90% (complete stable remission--14%; pharmacological remission--20%; minimal manifestation--56%), unchanged--8%, worsened--2%. Our results with a complete stable remission of 14% at the end of the first year and 50% at 5 years are at least comparable with literature results with other open or thoracoscopic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the early postoperative results of thymectomy operations after partial sternotomy and videothoracoscopy for myasthenia gravis. METHODS: A total of 51 thymectomy operations were reviewed. The surgical procedure was simple thymectomy with partial sternotomy in the first 19 patients (Group I) and videothoracoscopic thymectomy (Group II) in the remaining patients. Both groups were compared in terms of preoperative data (age, gender, classification, duration of disease, medications), operative data (operation time, the mean amount of drainage, the duration of chest tube drainage), and postoperative data (duration of hospital stay, complications and pain). RESULTS: Groups were statistically uniform in terms of preoperative and operative data. Statistically significant differences were noted for the duration of chest tube drainage (48.8 vs. 29.8 hours, p < 0.001), the amount of drainage (264.4 vs. 178.6 ml, p = 0.001), the length of hospital stay (5.6 vs. 2.3 days, p = 0.000), and the visual analogue scale score (4.8 vs. 3.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy with videothoracoscopic surgery demonstrated a more comfortable and faster recovery period without deterioration in myasthenic status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report our initial experience with the application of robotic-assisted technologies to the treatment of diseases of the anterior mediastinum. METHODS: Between October 2001 and December 2003, 18 consecutive patients with anterior mediastinal masses were referred for diagnosis and treatment. Fifteen patients underwent robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci robotic system. A single surgical team performed all operations. Resection was accomplished by either median sternotomy or robotic-assisted techniques. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent successful robotic-assisted thymectomy. One patient underwent robotic-assisted biopsy of a mass that was later determined to be a poorly differentiated carcinoma, 3 patients underwent complete thymectomy by median sternotomy for biopsy-proven extracapsular thymoma, 7 patients had thymoma, and 3 had myasthenia gravis. There were 2 patients each with benign thymic cysts and thymic hyperplasia. Primary thymic carcinoid, thymolipoma, papillary thyroid cancer, and poorly differentiated carcinoma were present in 1 patient each. No conversions, intraoperative complications, or deaths occurred in the 15 patients who underwent robotic-assisted resection. The mean operative time was 96 minutes (range 62 to 132 minutes). The mean robotic time was 48 minutes (range 22 to 76). The median hospital stay was 2 days. All patients are doing well, with a median follow-up of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted surgery of the anterior mediastinum, and particularly thymectomy, can be performed safely and efficiently. The increased visualization and instrument dexterity afforded by this technology provides an optimal minimally invasive approach to the anterior mediastinum. From this experience we have formulated a comprehensive treatment algorithm for the surgical evaluation and treatment of patients with anterior mediastinal diseases.

AB  - Intensive development of thoracoscopic thymectomy (Tthy) has been initiated during the last decade. Unfortunately very few instances of using the procedures have been described in Russian medical literature. So, the paper describes in detail the technique and results obtained in our clinic. At the period from 1998 through 2004 37 Tthy operations were performed in the St. Petersburg Center of intensive pulmonology and thoracic surgery. There were 21 female and 15 male patients with mean age 41.5+/-18.9 years. Myasthenia gravis (MG) was diagnosed in 19 of those patients. Different thoracoscopic approaches were used for Tthy: 20 from the right side, 15 from the left side and 2 combined approaches with neck incision. In 2 cases when invasive thymoma was suspected, sternotomy had to be used. There were 6 postoperative complications (1 haemothorax and 5 myasthenia cases). One patient died in 45 days after operation because of the ventilation-associated pneumonia. The results of treatment were followed up in 34 patients during 6-34 months. The MG course was followed up in 17 out of 19 patients, 9 (52.9%) being asymptomatic, 6 (35.3%) improved and 2 (11.8%) stable. Tthy is a novel technical possibility for a removal of the thymus gland. The procedure is quite safe and radical in the hand of a surgeon experienced in mediastinal and thoracoscopic surgery. Treatment of thymoma using Tthy requires meticulous technique and longer follow-up.

AB  - Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) provides a new approach to thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG). We compared the results of video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (VATT) and transternal thymectomy (TT) in Taiwanese people with MG. From January 1997 to August 2002, we enrolled a total of 82 patients with MG who underwent TT and anterior mediastinal adipose tissue removal in our study. Of those, 51 patients underwent VATT, and 31 patients underwent TT. The men-to-women ratios were 18:33 and 15:16 in the VATT and TT groups, respectively. The mean age was 37.9 +/- 17.56 years in the VATT group and 35.6 +/- 16.8 years in the TT group (P = 0.55). Preoperative Osserman's classification revealed the following: class I: 11 (21.6%), 13 (41.9%); class IIA: 18 (35.3%), 11 (35.5%); class IIB: 18 (35.3%), 5 (16.1%); class III: 2 (3.9%), 0; and class IV: 2 (3.9%), 2 (6.5%), respectively, in the two groups (P = 0.06). During VATT, all but two patients were placed supine in the 45 degrees left lateral decubitus position under double-lumen intubated anesthesia. Usually three 1-cm incision wounds over anterior axillary line at the third, fifth, and sixth intercostal spaces were necessary. A total of 82 patients (51 with VATT and 31 with TT) were studied. There were no statistical differences between the two groups of patients in terms of sex, age, and severity of MG. In VATT and TT groups, postoperative hospital stays were 6.1 +/- 3.3 and 26.9 +/- 14.1 days, respectively (P = 0.001). Intensive care unit stays were 1.5 +/- 1.1 and 3.2 +/- 2.3 days, respectively (P = 0.018). Operative times were 180.0 +/- 53.4 and 248.2 +/- 71.9 minutes, respectively (P = 0.004). Thymus weights were 43.7 +/- 22.5 and 52.2 +/- 29.6 g, respectively (P = 0.141). Fifty-one VATT procedures were performed through a right-side approach without conversion. Most patients were extubated in the operating room or recovery room. The harvested thymus glands had an average weight of 49.4 g (range, 21.4-90 g). There were no surgical mortality cases. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.574) in the postoperative improvement classification between the two groups, with a mean of 4 years of follow-up. In the VATT group, 14 (27.5%) patients had complete remission without any medication, 14 (27.5%) patients were in class II, 21 (41.1%) patients were in class III, 2 (3.9%) patients were in class IV, and 0 (0%) patients were in class V, according to postoperative classification of DeFilippi et al. We concluded that VATT is technically feasible and safe and is associated with a favorable postoperative outcome compared with the transsternal approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a prospective study, the effect of thymectomy on the pulmonary status of 50 consecutive patients with myasthenia gravis was evaluated over a time range of 4 years in the Chest and Chest surgery departments in the Cairo University Clinics and Thoracic Surgery Department of the Evangelisches Krankenhaus Duisburg-Nord. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: Group I included 26 patients who underwent thymectomy through median sternotomy. The mean age of the patients in this group was 24.8+/-10.5 (5-41) years. They were 19 females and seven males. Thirteen of the patients were in Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class IIa, and 12 were in class IIb, and one was in class IIIa. Group II included 24 patients who underwent thymectomy through manubriotomy. The mean age of the patients in this group was 25.2+/-9.2 (12-41) years. They were 13 females and 11 males. Eight of the patients were in MGFA class 2a, 14 were in class IIb, and two were in class IIIa. RESULTS: When compared to group I in which postoperative ventilation was required in 15.4% of patients, postoperative ventilation was not necessary in patients of group II with a statistically significant difference (P=0.04). The mean duration of stay in the intensive care unit was 111.4h in group II, and 169.7h in group I (P=0.03). The peak inspiratory flow rate and the forced vital capacity were also statistically significantly better in group II. There was no mortality in both groups, and the morbidity was higher in the median sternotomy group. CONCLUSION: Thymectomy through a manubriotomy, which allows extensive removal of ectopic thymic tissue in addition to the thymus through a less invasive approach than a full median sternotomy, is associated with a significantly smoother postoperative course and less pulmonary complications, when compared with thymectomy through a full median sternotomy.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease that usually responds positively to treatment with thymectomy. Standard surgical procedures have been shown to result in a favorite outcome. The optimal surgical access, however, is under discussion. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a prospective study conducted between 8/97 and 4/05, 173 patients with MG underwent thoracoscopic thymectomy, for which a left-sided approach was generally applied. An analysis of the intraoperative and postoperative course was performed in 137 patients (8/97 and 12/03), as well as of the impact of the surgical procedure on further development of the disease. The results obtained were compared with those published in the literature, with particular reference to results obtained with open surgery. In 8 patients, the procedure was converted to an anterolateral thoracotomy or sternotomy, so we examined 129 patients, which were operated thoracoscopically. RESULTS: The patients in this study were 93 females and 36 males, with a mean age of 35.8 (range: 9-83) years. The mean preoperative duration of the disease was 22.9 (range: 1-140) months. The duration of operation was 50 to 85 minutes, the blood loss was lower than 100 ml. The mean follow up was 24.7 (range: 1-57) months. Complete remission was noted in 30 patients (23.3 %), and improvements reflected either in a reduction of the required medication, or a decrease in symptom severity, were seen in a total of 86 patients (66.6 %). CONCLUSION: Complete thoracoscopic thymectomy is a technically feasible operation, and as effective as conventional open surgery. Remissions or symptomatic improvements were observed in more than 89 % of the patients. The low morbidity rate, in combination with excellent cosmetic results, has led to increasing acceptance of the operation both by patients and neurologists. Therefore, thoracoscopic thymectomy represents a new, alternative method for treatment of patients with MG.

AB  - The optimal approach to thymectomy remains controversial. This study is designed to prospectively compare the results between bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (BVTx) and extended transsternal thymectomy (ETTx) in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) without thymoma. Fifteen patients who had undergone BVTx and 16 patients who had undergone ETTx were compared for age, gender, severity of disease, preoperative duration of disease, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, hospital stay, duration of chest tube drainage, thymic histopathology, pain perception by visual analog scale (VAS), remission and improvement rate, period of follow-up, and activities of daily living (ADL). Fisher's exact test, t test and paired t test were used for statistical analysis. BVTx had longer operative time and less intraoperative blood loss than that of the ETTx. Their remission rates and their degree of postoperative ADL improvement were not significantly different. However, the lowering of VAS was significantly greater in the sternotomy group at 3 months. All other parameters were not significantly different. No mortality was noted in the series. We consider BVTx as an effective alternative procedure to the transsternal approach for patients with nonthymomatous MG. As more and more people care about cosmetics, BVTx could become the future trend.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of the technique of thymectomy on late results in the treatment of myasthenia gravis remains controversial. METHODS: Results of 60 basic transsternal thymectomies and 58 extended transsternal thymectomies were compared. Both positive results (complete remissions or improvement) and negative results (no improvement, deterioration, or death from myasthenia) were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no differences between both groups according to patient's characteristics and postoperative complications rate. Ectopic foci of the thymic tissue were discovered in the fat of the neck and the mediastinum in 56.9% of patients from the extended thymectomy group. The foci occurred in all areas of dissection of the neck and the mediastinum. Complete remission rates in the basic thymectomy group were 8.3%, 11.7%, 15.0%, 16.7%, 20.0%, and 21.7% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years of follow-up, respectively, and 29.3%, 37.9%, 41.4%. and 46.6% after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively, in the extended thymectomy group. The differences between both groups after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were statistically significant (p = 0.0093, p = 0.0013, p = 0.0018, and p = 0.0007, respectively). Negative results were noted in 23.3% of patients in the basic thymectomy group and in 6.9% of patients in the extended thymectomy group (p = 0.0613). No other factors had any influence on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Late results, both positive and negative, were considerably better in the extended thymectomy group. The difference can be explained by the removal of ectopic foci of the thymic tissue from the neck and the mediastinum in these patients. [References: 23]

AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of extended rethymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis. Additionally, an original technique of resternotomy is described. Extended rethymectomy was performed on 21 patients with refractory myastenic symptoms after a previous transsternal thymectomy. In 8 patients the original video-assisted technique of complete longitudinal resternotomy with the aid of a special sternal retractor elevating the sternum from above and below was used. Severe intraoperative haemorrhage from the lacerated left innominate vein occurred in 3/13 patients operated on before the video-assisted technique of resternotomy had been introduced. In none of the 8 patients operated on with video-assisted resternotomy such a complication was noted. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: retained thymic lobe (4/21 patients), ectopic foci of thymic tissue (13/21 patients) no thymic tissue (4/21 patients). Results of follow-up: complete remission (11.8%), improvement (64.7%); no improvement (35.3%) during the follow-up period (mean 3.4 years). There was neither deterioration of myasthenia nor mortality during follow-up in this group. We conclude that described technique of video-assisted resternotomy reliably prevents the laceration of the heart and great vessels, and that complete remission and improvement rates in patients operated on with the extended rethymectomy are relatively low but deterioration of myasthenia is prevented.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thymectomy is considered an effective therapeutic option for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). We reviewed our 25-years experience with surgical treatment of MG with respect to long-term results and factors affecting outcome. METHODS: Between 1978 and 2002, we performed 232 thymectomies for MG. Fifteen patients were lost to follow-up; the remaining 217 form the object of our study. 32 patients (28.4%) had thymoma. Myasthenia was graded according to a modified Osserman classification: 51 patients (23.5%) were in class I, 81 (37.3%) in class IIA, 52 (24%) in class IIB, 26 (12%) in class III and seven (3.2%) in class IV. Mean duration of symptoms before the operation was 14 +/- 10 months. Fifty-eight thymectomies for thymoma were performed through a median sternotomy and four through a clamshell incision. Forty-six thymectomies for non-thymomatous MG were performed through a standard cervicotomy, 155 procedures through a partial upper sternal-splitting incision and eight through a complete median sternotomy. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 0.92% (two patients). After a mean follow-up of 119 months, 77% of all patients improved their clinical status (26% without medications and asymptomatic; 45% with a reduction of medications and/or clinically improved); 39 (18%) have a stable disease with no clinical modifications; 12 (5%) presented a deterioration of their clinical status with worse symptoms, required more medications, or both. Thirteen patients (6%) died because of MG (mean survival 34.3 +/- 3.6 months). The presence of a thymoma negatively influenced the prognosis. Younger patients showed a more favorable outcome as well as patients with a shorter duration of symptoms before the operation; patients with lower classes of myasthenia showed a higher rate of remission. CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy is effective in the management of patients with MG at all stages with low morbidity. Patients with thymoma present a less favorable outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of the right thoracoscopic (RtT) approach and the subxiphoid bilateral thoracoscopic (SxBiT) approach in performing thymectomy for myasthenia gravis. METHODS: Between March 2001 and April 2003, 27 myasthenic patients were enrolled in this prospective study. The operations were conducted by two surgical teams in a single institute. The surgical procedures included RtT for 12 patients and SxBiT for 15 patients. The operation time, resected thymus weights, and thoracic drainage periods were compared. RESULTS: Subxiphoid video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (SxVATET) and right-side thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (RtVATET) were performed for 27 consecutive myasthenic patients. The mean operation time, weights of resected specimens, and duration of hospital stay for the SxVATET and RtVATET groups were, respectively, 151.3 min (range, 120-200 min) versus 191.5 min (range, 120-225 min) (p = 0.0012), 73.3 g (range, 40-90 g) versus 50.8 g (range, 5-90 g) (p = 0.0029), and 3.1 days (range, 2-4 days) versus 3.8 days (range, 2-4 days) (p = 0.914). Ten patients (37%) had complete remission, observed during a mean follow-up period of 18.5 months (range, 6-30 months). CONCLUSIONS: During this consecutive experience, both the RtT and SxBiT approaches showed satisfactory results for nonthymomatous myasthenic patients. However, a better view of the bilateral pleural cavities and more radical thymectomy could be achieved only by the SxBiT approach.

AB  - VATS thymectomy can be performed for myasthenia gravis with results comparable to sternotomy. It is cosmetically pleasing and generally patients are discharged within two days. There are no lifting restrictions or healing concerns such as exist with sternal incisions. Minimally invasive routes for resection of thymomas remain controversial. VATS resection has been described and is quite feasible for small tumors. The concern of drop metastases or compromise of oncologic results has caused most surgeons to use median sternotomy for these tumor resections. The completeness of thymic resection has been questioned. However, our comparison of 33 cases did not show any inferior results, in fact, 88% (29/33) showed clinical improvement. Our data analysis compared with nine published series performed by other approaches showed no difference in clinical outcomes based on the surgical approach. Thymectomy may be considered a more advanced VATS procedure and probably best done by those with moderate prior VATS experience. Thoracoscopic thymectomy provides better visualization than the cervical route and cosmetic superiority to sternotomy. As long as a complete thymic resection can be achieved then it is a viable surgical approach. By providing a minimally invasive approach VATS may lead to wider acceptance of earlier thymectomies by myasthenia gravis patients and their neurologists. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim of the study. Comparison of early and late non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis treatment results by means of basic and extended transsternal thymectomies. Material and methods. The study group comprised treatment results obtained from 61 patients operated by means of basic thymectomy using the upper median sternotomy approach during the period between 1996-1997, and 57 patients operated by means of extended transsternal thymectomy (removal of the thymus with adipose tissue of the neck and mediastinum) using the complete median sternotomy approach during the period between 1998-1999. Early (morbidity rate) and late results, including clinical improvement rates and complete remission rates (no myasthenic symptoms and no anti-myasthenic drugs necessary) were compared. Results. There were no mortalities in both groups. Morbidity rates were comparable in both groups. In case of the basic thymectomy group complete remission rates after 1-, 2- and 3 years of follow-up amounted to 9.8%, 14.8% and 18.0%, respectively, while in the extended thymectomy group 28.1%, 38.6% and 42.1%, respectively (p<0.05). The improvement rate amounted to 77% in case of the basic thymectomy group and 89.5% in the extended thymectomy group (p=0.07). No other factor (histology of the thymus gland, sex, age, duration of symptoms and severity of MG in Osserman scale) had any impact on results. Ectopic thymic tissue foci were discovered in the fat of the neck and mediastinum in 57.8% of patients in the extended thymectomy group. Conclusions. 1. Morbidity after extended thymectomy was not increased, in comparison to basic thymectomy. 2. The complete remission rate of myasthenic symptoms is significantly higher in patients operated by means of extended thymectomy, in comparison to patients after basic thymectomy. 3. Result difference was due to the removal of ectopic thymic tissue foci, following extended thymectomy, in all regions of the neck and mediastinum where adipose tissue was dissected.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of thymectomy in a group of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) with associated connective tissue diseases (CTD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed six patients with CTD and myasthenia. They were followed-up for at least 3 years. RESULTS: Records of a cohort of 132 patients with established diagnosis of MG undergoing thymectomy in our institution between 1987-1999 were reviewed. The percentage of patients with CTD was 5 % (6/132). Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and one patient systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). All patients were women, and the mean age was 38.5 years old (SD 13.7). Mean time of MG diagnosis to operation was 16 months (range from 1 to 144 months). Preoperative Osserman classification was the following: stage IIb, four patients; stage III, one patient; and stage IV, one patient. Before surgery all patients were on anticholinesterase agent (pyridostigmine), and four patients were on corticosteroids. An extended transsternal thymectomy was practiced on five patients and a transcervical thymectomy was performed in the remaining patient. Pathologic findings were as follows: thymic hyperplasia in four patients and thymic atrophy in the other two. Good response (remission or improvement) was present in three patients (50 %) and poor response (no change or worse) in the other three (50 %). CONCLUSIONS: A low response to the thymectomy is observed in patients with MG and associated CTD (RA and an SLE).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the lack of evidence-based data comparing different techniques for thymectomy (Thx), a matched-pair study was conducted to evaluate the role of thoracoscopic Thx (tThx) more objectively. METHODS: Of 182 patients who underwent Thx, 3 groups according to the operation technique were matched for myasthenia gravis (MG) without thymoma, age, gender, and severity of MG. Twenty patients each who had Thx through anterolateral thoracotomy (aThx), extended median sternotomy (sThx), and tThx were compared for length of operation, postoperative morbidity, complete remission, quantification of improvement of MG, and cosmetic results. RESULTS: Complete tThx required 197 +/- 35 min as compared to 113 +/- 43 min for sThx and 82 +/- 27 min for aThx (P <0.001). With zero mortality the overall postoperative morbidity rate was 25% for sThx versus 15% for aThx and 5% for tThx (P <0.05). There was no difference in complete remission of MG. The median activities of daily living (ADL) scores improved by 6.0 (1-19) after tThx, 5.5 (2-4) after sThx, and 7.5 (0-12) after aThx. Best cosmetic results were achieved after tThx. CONCLUSIONS: There was adequate cumulative medium-term improvement of MG and less postoperative morbidity after tThx, which may become the preferred technique for Thx.

AB  - The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy (VATET) as a treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG) and to identify prognostic factors for thymectomy success. Clinical efficacy and variables influencing outcome were assessed by life-table and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Complete stable remission (CSR), as defined by the MGFA Medical Task Force, was the end point for efficacy. VATET was performed in 159 MG patients and T-3b in 47 MG patients. At 6 years of follow-up, CSR, assessed by life-table analysis, was 50.6% in non-thymomatous VATET patients and 48.7% in non-thymomatous T-3b surgery. By univariate analysis, the presence of thymic hyperplasia (P=0.0002) and treatment only with anticholinesterases (P<0.0001) were positively associated with the probability of CSR. By multivariate analysis, the chance of complete remission was significantly increased by the use of anticholinesterases (odds ratio [OR] 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-4.17; P=0.001) and the presence of thymic hyperplasia (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.05-3.68; P=0.036). VATET seems to be effective in inducing CSR in MG with an efficiency similar to that of the T-3b transsternal (TS) approach; it is easy to perform in experienced hands and is associated with low morbidity and negligible esthetic sequelae.

AB  - Data from 756 myasthenic patients were analyzed for diagnostic criteria, clinical aspects, and therapeutic approaches. The patients were followed up at our institution from 1981 to 2001. Clinical evaluation was performed according to the myasthenia gravis score adopted at our clinic. Clinical features of each patient (comprising demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, immunological, radiological, and surgical data, as well as serial myasthenia gravis scores) were filed in a relational database containing more than 7000 records. Clinical efficacy and variables influencing outcome were assessed by life-table methods and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Complete stable remission, as defined by the Task Force of the Medical Scientific Advisory Board of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, was the end point for good prognosis. Four hundred and ninety-nine patients (66%) were female and 257 (34%) were male. Mean follow-up was 55.1 +/- 48.1 months. Onset of symptoms peaked in the third decade in females, whereas the male distribution was bimodal with peaks in the third and sixth decades. Modality of myasthenia gravis presentation was as follows: ocular, 39.3%; generalized, 28.5%; bulbar, 31.3%; and respiratory, 0.8%. Thymectomy was carried out on 63.7% of our patients by different approaches: (1) transcervical; (2) transsternal; (3) video-thoracoscopic mini-invasive surgery. The last approach has been preferentially used in more recent years and accounted for 62.4% of the thymectomized myasthenia gravis population. Univariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that variables such as sex (female), age at onset (below 40 years), thymectomy, and histological diagnosis of thymic hyperplasia were significantly associated with complete stable remission, whereas on multivariate analysis only age at onset below 40 years and thymectomy were confirmed.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is an effective, but radical therapy for myasthenia. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) may allow a minimally invasive alternative to the standard sternotomy approach. AIMS: To audit prospectively the outcome of VATS thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in a unit specializing in advanced VATS techniques. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent VATS thymectomy between 1997 and 2001. Most underwent preoperative plasma exchange therapy. Seventeen women and nine men with a median age of 36 years (range 17-71 years) had a right-sided VATS approach to remove all anterior mediastinal fat and thymic tissue. RESULTS: There was no perioperative mortality and all procedures were concluded successfully, with one patient requiring sternotomy. Twenty-five patients were extubated in theatre and one patient required 17 h of assisted ventilation. The other significant complication was a diathermy injury to the phrenic nerve, which recovered. Median postoperative stay was 4 days (range 2-6 days), with median postoperative chest drainage for 2 days (range 1-3 days). Three patients had progression of disease postoperatively. The remainder were asymptomatic (7), improved (14) or stable (2). CONCLUSION: In a dedicated unit with neurological and intensive care support, VATS thymectomy is a safe, effective method of obtaining remission or improvement in myasthenia gravis (MG). While achieving the same surgical goal, this approach offers advantages of improved cosmesis, shorter recovery time and minimal chest wall disruption over the gold standard of sternotomy. Better patient acceptance of this minimally invasive technique may result in wider application of the benefits of thymectomy in MG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains controversial whether transcervical thymectomy offers results equivalent to thymectomy by way of a median sternotomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Furthermore, preoperative prognostic factors have not been clearly defined. METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review and interview of 78 patients completing transcervical thymectomy for myasthenia gravis between 1992 and 1999. RESULTS: There were 24 men and 54 women. Mean age was 40 years (range, 13 to 78 years). Twelve patients were in Osserman class 1, 25 in class 2, 30 in class 3, and 11 in class 4 (mean, 2.5). There was no perioperative mortality and 6 (7.7%) morbidities. Mean length of stay was 1.5 days and mean follow-up, 54.6 months. The crude cumulative complete remission (asymptomatic off medications for 6 months) rate was 39.7% (n = 31). Only 8 patients (10.3%) failed to improve after transcervical thymectomy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of complete remission were 31% and 43% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Eight patients with thymoma had a 5-year estimated complete remission rate of 75% in contrast to 43% in 38 patients with thymic hyperplasia and 36% in 32 patients with neither thymoma nor hyperplasia (p = 0.01). Twelve patients with ocular myasthenia had a 5-year estimated complete remission rate of 57%, whereas patients with mild-to-moderate (n = 55) or severe (n = 11) generalized symptoms had 5-year complete remission rates of 43% and 30%, respectively (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, extended transcervical thymectomy offers results that are comparable to those published for the transsternal procedure. Patients with milder disease (including isolated ocular disease) and taking no preoperative immunosuppressive agents appear to experience higher remission rates. In contrast to previous studies, we also find that small thymomas predict better responses to thymectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is considered the most effective treatment for achieving sustained improvement as well as remission in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), and most neurologists favor the use of this procedure. The main focus of many current studies is to determine response-predicting factors. METHODS: Clinical records of 152 patients with an established diagnosis of MG who underwent thymectomy at our institution were reviewed. The purpose was to evaluate outcome of surgical management for MG and prognostic factors that influence that outcome. RESULTS: The majority of patients were women (119 of 152); mean age was 32.10 +/- 14.42 years, while time elapsed from diagnosis to surgery was 20.67 +/- 19.7 months. Transsternal thymectomy was performed on 113 patients and transcervical on 39. Forty percent of patients achieved remission and 28% showed improvement; with this, a good response to thymectomy was seen in 68% of patients (n = 103). The most important variables associated with remission were <60 years of age, <2 years of preoperative symptoms, and use of pyridostigmine at low doses. Factors related with poor response were >60 years of age, preoperative Osserman stage other than II, use of high doses of pyridostigmine, use of corticosteroids, and presence of thymic atrophy or thymoma in histopathologic analyses. There was no mortality, although 20 patients (13%) presented complications. CONCLUSIONS: Mexican patients with MG undergoing thymectomies show improvement and remission rates similar to those reported by other studies. Age, length of symptoms, thymic pathology, and medications appear to be predictors of response to thymectomy for MG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thymectomy is an effective and accepted treatment for myasthenia gravis, but thymectomy for ocular myasthenia gravis (Osserman stage I) is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and propriety of thymectomy for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis. METHODS: We conducted a review and follow-up of all patients who had thymectomy for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis between 1970 and 1998 at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, and the University of Rome, "La Sapienza," Rome, Italy. Patient response to thymectomy was categorized as follows: cured, patients who became symptom-free and required no further medication; improved, patients who required less medication and whose symptoms were less severe; unchanged, patients whose symptoms and medications were the same; worse, patients who had more severe symptoms, needed more medication, or died. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (mean age 37 years; range 14-73 years) were followed up for a mean duration of 9 years (range 0.5-29 years). Ocular myasthenia gravis with mixed and cortical thymomas, stages I to IV, occurred in 12 patients, and ocular myasthenia without thymomas occurred in 49 patients. Transsternal thymectomy (n = 55) and transcervical thymectomy (n = 6) resulted in cure in 31 (51%) patients, improvement in 12 (20%) patients, no change in 16 (26%) patients, and worsening of symptoms (including 1 postoperative death) in 2 patients. Patient outcomes were statistically independent of the duration of preoperative symptoms (mean 9.5 months), patient age, or the presence or absence of thymoma. In patients with ocular myasthenia, 70% were cured or improved after thymectomy; in the subgroup of patients with ocular myasthenia and thymoma, 67% were cured or improved. CONCLUSION: Thymectomy is an effective and safe treatment for patients with ocular myasthenia gravis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our overall experience on 163 patients, affected by myasthenia gravis, who underwent thymectomy between 1976 and 1998. A comparison between the oldest series of 72 patients (January 1976-December 1992), referred by various neurologists and operated on through different approaches, and the last 91 patients (January 1993-December 1998), taking part in a strict diagnostic-therapeutical programme, was made. METHODS: Anagraphic data, duration of symptoms, the surgical approach, necessity of respiratory assistance, the hospital stay, histopathological findings, preoperative and postoperative Osserman classification, as well as medications, were globally analyzed and then compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in the length of hospitalization (8.7 days vs. 4.2 days; P=0.00001) and in the prolonged intubation rate (18 vs. 0; P<0.000001) were observed in the most recent series. Patients in the pre-operative Osserman stage I and operated on in the second period had a higher complete remission rate at the univariate analysis (P<0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively). At the multivariate analysis the only parameter which affected the outcome was to be operated on in the second period (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirms the role of the extended thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Whenever an extended thymectomy was performed through a complete sternotomy it was a quick procedure, with short hospitalization and acceptable cosmetic results. A careful pharmacological control of the myasthenic symptoms and the presence of team-work among neurologist, thoracic surgeon and anaesthesist in the peri-operative setting reduce the incidence of complications and might increase the efficacy of the thymectomy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the evolution of the perioperative management of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients undergoing thymectomy and to question the need for systematic postoperative ventilation. CLINICAL FEATURES: We collected data retrospectively from 36 consecutive MG patients who underwent thymectomy over a 21-yr period, via transthoracic, -cervical or -sternal incisions (n=5, n=7, n=24, respectively). From 1980 to 1993, a balanced anesthetic technique (n=24) included various inhalational agents with opiates and myorelaxants (in eight cases); 22 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Since 1994, i.v. propofol was combined with epidural bupivacaine and sufentanil (n=12); all patients were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. Short-term postoperative ventilation (median time four hours, range from three to 48 hr) was required in eight patients who had longer hospital stay (median stay=12 days, range (8-28) vs five days (4-15) for patients with early extubation, P <0.05) but similar clinical improvement six months after thymectomy. Postoperative ventilatory support was required more frequently when a balanced anesthetic technique was used (odds ratio=4.2 (1.1-9.7), P=0.03) and particularly when myorelaxants were given (odds ratio=13.9 (2.1-89.8), P=0.009). Leventhal's scoring system had low sensitivity (22.2%) and positive predictive values (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the severity of MG failed to predict the need for postoperative ventilation. A combined anesthetic technique was a safe and cost-effective alternative to balanced anesthesia as it provided optimal operating conditions and resulted in fewer admissions in ICU and shorter hospital stays.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired pulmonary function due to myasthenia gravis (MG) is further compromised by thymectomy, which is necessary in most cases. Thoracoscopic thymectomy (tThx) can achieve the same resection and functional improvement of MG as median sternotomy (sThx). The possible advantage of tThx in maintaining better perioperative lung function was quantified. METHODS: In a prospective trial, 20 patients with MG were randomly allocated to undergo tThx (n = 10) by three-trocar left-sided approach or sThx (n = 10) performed as an extended procedure. Complete pulmonary function was measured at 12-hour intervals, beginning 6 hours postoperatively. Effective postoperative pain control in both groups was achieved by patient-controlled analgesia with morphine sulfate assessed by a visual analogue scale. Statistical analysis for comparison of tThx and sThx was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Postoperative vital capacity, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume per second, and peak expiratory flow, measured as a percentage of the individual preoperative capacity, were significantly better with tThx compared with sThx. Immediate postoperative lung function was reduced to 35% and 65% after tThx and sThx, respectively. By the third postoperative day, recovery of pulmonary function was complete after tThx but only 55% after sThx. CONCLUSIONS: Less pronounced impairment and faster recovery of pulmonary function after tThx characterize this new approach for thymectomy as minimally invasive. These results could make tThx the preferred surgical treatment of MG, which was improved to the same extent as after sThx.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of thoracoscopic completion thymectomy in patients with refractory nonthymomatous myasthenia. METHODS: Eight patients were operated upon after transcervical (n = 6) or transsternal (n = 2) thymectomy. The mean interval between operations was 129 months. Every patient was completely disabled despite treatment with large dosages of prednisone in combination with pyridostigmine (n = 5) or azathioprine (n = 3) and with repeated plasma exchanges. RESULTS: Gross (n = 5) or microscopic (n = 3) residual thymic tissue was found in all patients. There was no mortality, but morbidity included 2 patients with postoperative myasthenic crisis requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation. The mean hospital stay was 4.75 days. The mean follow-up was 28.3 months. At the last follow-up, 6 patients had achieved symptomatic improvement as expressed by significant change in mean Osserman class (3.37 versus 2.12, p = 0.03), and prednisone dosage (43 versus 20 mg/d, p = 0.03). Conversely, there was no difference in dosage of pyridostigmine and azathioprine or in number of exchange cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that thoracoscopic completion thymectomy may be beneficial for selected patients with refractory nonthymomatous myasthenia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thymectomy is considered an effective therapeutic option for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). We reviewed our 27-year experience with surgical treatment of MG with respect to long-term results and factors affecting outcome. METHODS: Between 1970 and 1997, we performed 232 thymectomies for MG. Fifteen patients were lost to follow-up; the remaining 217 form the object of our study. Sixty-two patients (28.4%) had thymoma. Myasthenia was graded according to a modified Osserman classification: 51 patients (23.5%) were in class I, 81(37.3%) in class IIA, 52 (24%) in class IIB, 26 (12%) in class III and seven (3.2%) in class IV. Mean duration of symptoms before the operation was 12+/-10 months. Fifty-eight thymectomies for thymoma were performed through a median sternotomy and four through a clamshell incision. Forty-six thymectomies for non-thymomatous MG were performed through a standard cervicotomy, 101 procedures through a partial upper sternal-splitting incision and eight through a complete median sternotomy. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 0.92% (two patients). After a mean follow-up of 119 months, 71% of all patients improved their clinical status (25% without medications and asymptomatic; 46% with a reduction of medications and/or clinically improved); 39 (18%) have a stable disease with no clinical modifications; 12 (5%) presented a deterioration of their clinical status with worse symptoms, required more medications, or both. Thirteen patients (6%) died because of MG (mean survival 34.3+/-3.6 months). The presence of a thymoma negatively influenced the prognosis. Younger patients showed a more favorable outcome as well as patients with a shorter duration of symptoms before the operation; patients with lower classes of myasthenia showed a higher rate of remission. CONCLUSIONS: Thymectomy is effective in the management of patients with MG at all stages with low morbidity. Patients with thymoma present a less favorable outcome.

AB  - In most cases, myasthenia gravis (MG) and thymoma require complete removal of the thymus gland and resection of the pericardial fatty tissue. There is some debate however, over which surgical approach is best for thymectomy. We have developed a new technique for complete thoracoscopic thymectomy. Between October 1994 and February 1998, we performed a prospective observational study of thoracoscopic thymectomy in 19 patients. The results were analyzed with special reference to perioperative morbidity, short- and intermediate-term improvement of MG, and quality of life. This study showed the feasibility of complete thoracoscopic thymectomy. The procedure was successfully applied in 19 of 20 cases. Thoracoscopic thymectomy was accomplished with zero mortality and a very low perioperative morbidity. While the short-term improvement of MG after this procedure was comparable to that seen with conventional surgery, the short- and intermediate-term quality of life was much better. The preliminary results of thoracoscopic thymectomy appear to be excellent for both patients and neurologists. A prospective randomized trial has been designed to compare thoracoscopic thymectomy with the gold standard of median sternotomy for thymectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG) involves the use of anticholinesterase agents, immunosuppressive drugs, plasmapheresis, and gamma-globulin. However, these agents result in a complete clinical remission rate as low as 15%. As a consequence, thymectomy, preferably by transsternal approach, has become increasingly accepted as an efficacious procedure for MG, with reported complete clinical remission rates as high as 80%. METHODS: We have the clinical records of 61 patients diagnosed with MG at La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, from January 1977 to December 1994. All patients underwent thymectomy. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the major prognostic factors predicting MG outcome after operation. RESULTS: Our results indicate that patients with a length of the disease from onset to operation shorter than 8 months have the best prognosis. Ossermann stages I and III are also associated with higher complete clinical remission rates. In contrast, neither age nor sex were found to be significantly related to MG outcome after thymectomy, although female patients have better prognosis than men, and the younger the patient the more likely is complete clinical remission. Pathologic findings after the operation were not found to be of prognostic value either. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that thymectomy is a beneficial procedure for MG patients, with a complete clinical remission rate of 46% at 5 years postoperatively in our series. Therefore we advocate thymectomy for MG patients as early as possible in the course of disease because time elapsed from diagnosis to operation is the main determinant of the outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the results of the authors' most recent 100 consecutive cases of transcervical thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (MG) in terms of complications and outcome in comparison with other reported techniques. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Myasthenia gravis is believed to be an autoimmune disorder characterized by increasing fatigue with exertion. The role of thymectomy in the management of the disease remains unproven, but there is widespread acceptance of the notion that complete thymectomy improves the course of the disease. Complete excision of the thymus is the goal in all cases; however, the best technique to achieve complete thymectomy remains controversial. The authors favor a transcervical approach through a small collar incision aided by a specially designed sternal retractor. Others prefer a transsternal, a combined transcervical and transsternal ("maximal"), or a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical approach. METHODS: A retrospective review of the authors' most recent 100 consecutive transcervical thymectomies for nonthymoma-associated MG was performed using medical records and telephone interviews. Patients' symptoms were graded before surgery and at the most recent (within the last 6 months) postoperative time point, using the modified Osserman classification: 0 = asymptomatic, 1 = ocular signs and symptoms, 2 = mild generalized weakness, 3 = moderate generalized weakness, bulbar dysfunction, or both, and 4 = severe generalized weakness, respiratory dysfunction, or both. RESULTS: There were 61 female patients and 39 male patients with a mean age of 38 years (range, 14 to 84). The median hospital stay was 1 day. There were no deaths and no significant complications. Seventy-eight patients who had undergone surgery >12 months ago were available for analysis. In these patients, with a mean follow-up time of 5 years (median 5.3; range, 12 months to 10 years), the median preoperative Osserman grade improved from 3.0 (mean 2.73) before surgery to 1.0 after surgery (mean 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: The transcervical approach for thymectomy for the treatment of MG produces results similar to those of other surgical approaches, with the added benefits of shortened hospital stay, decreased complications, reduced cost, and broader physician and patient acceptance of surgical treatment.

AB  - The clinical records of 24 of the 31 patients who underwent thymectomy for myasthenia gravis from January 1991 to December 1995 were reviewed. The mean age of patients was 36.5 years, with a male : female ratio of 1 : 5. The average duration of symptoms prior to consultation was 16.6 months. Most of the patients presented diplopia with clinical stage IIA prior to surgery. The most common procedure utilized was thymectomy via a median sternotomy under general anesthesia-epidural anesthesia. Five of the 24 patients (21%) were immediately extubated postoperatively while 19 remained intubated, with 12 patients attached to a ventilator. Extubation ranged from the first postoperative day up to more than two weeks postoperatively. The average length of ICU stay was 8.1 days and the average length of hospital stay was 31.1 days. The most common morbidity was pneumonia (38%). One patient had a brief reactive psychosis and another patient had phrenic nerve injury which manifested 2 weeks postoperatively. The average length of follow-up was 14.8 months and the mean follow-up period was 24.5 months. There was a general trend of decrease in the dose of medication. However, there was an increase in the medication in 3 patients with 2 showing clinical improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reviewed the long-term clinical outcome after transcervical thymectomy for generalized myasthenia gravis without thymoma in 52 patients who had this procedure at The Toronto Hospital between 1977 and 1986, and compared the results with those reported after more radical surgical approaches. METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative patient evaluations were based on a modified Osserman classification. We defined complete remission as asymptomatic with normal strength and without medications for myasthenia gravis. The complete remission rate was selected as the best measure for comparison between different surgical approaches. RESULTS: The 52 patients were followed up for a mean of 8.4 years (+/-6.1 years [standard deviation]). The preoperative mean Osserman grade was 2.7 compared with 0.4 at final follow-up. Complete remission occurred in 44.2% of patients. Similar results are reported after transsternal thymectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Comparable results after transcervical and transsternal thymectomy favor the use of the less radical approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To give a modern concept for treating tumours of the thymic gland. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all patients treated for thymic disease in the last 6 years with a mean follow-up of 22.3 months (range: 3-71 months). SETTING: All patients were admitted to the Department of Surgery of the University of Cologne with an average hospitalisation period of 14 days. Patients with myasthenia gravis were transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively. PATIENTS: A total of 34 patients were treated by radical thymectomy. All patients had a routine chest roentgenogram and a computed tomography. In 13 patients a malignant tumour of the thymic gland was diagnosed. In 6 patients the main symptom was myasthenia gravis. INTERVENTIONS: All tumours were successfully resected by an upper median sternotomy which was extended through a Kocher incision (n = 2) or a complete sternotomy (n = 3). In one patient the tumour was unresectable. RESULTS: In four patients histological examination showed a thymic carcinoma and in 9 patients an invasive thymoma. Four patients died during follow-up period. Stage II to IV thymoma should receive postoperative radiotherapy and an additionally chemotherapy in stage IV. Cumulative survival rate for a five years follow-up independent of the tumour stage was 46%. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumours of the thymic gland are a rare entity and should be treated by radical resection of the tumour and the adjacent tissue. In stage II and III postoperative radiation can lower the risk of recurrence. In stage IV radiation should combined with chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up is mandatory. [References: 41]

AB  - In the present study, the role of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) has been analysed for 70 simple or thymomatous MG patients that underwent surgical intervention between July, 1983 and May, 1994. A total of 25 males and 45 females, with a mean age of 36.9 +/- 14.6 years, constituted the sample. Of these, twenty three (33.9%) patients had concurrent thymoma (thymomatous MG), the diagnosis of which was confirmed on the basis of clinical symptoms, Tensilon test, electrophysiological studies or serum acetylcholine receptor antibody (AchR) titer. Also, chest computed tomography was performed to detect the existence of thymoma, and clinical MG staging was determined preoperatively and monitored during the follow-up period. Transsternal extended thymectomy (including mediastinal fat dissection) was undertaken for patients with simple MG, whereas thymothymectomy through sternotomy or sternothoracotomy was undertaken for ones with thymomatous MG. No postoperative death was noted and only two patients, showing MG symptoms, needed prolonged ventilatory support (> 7 days) postoperatively. However, two patients died of thymoma recurrence or metastasis. The outcome (remission and surgical beneficial curve) was analyzed, and the possible influencing factor such as age, sex, existence of thymoma, MG durations before thymectomy, MG staging or the pathology of thymus, was analyzed based ont he univariate and multivariate Cox model. The surgical remission and beneficial rates for the presant patients, at the end of follow-up period, are 35.7% and 87.1% respectively, and the existence of thymoma is found to be the single most significant factor of which adversely influences the outcome. In this series it was also found that younger (< 40 years old) or female patients have significantly higher possibility of acquiring simple MG, than the male or older patients. It may hence be concluded that thymectomy is an effective treatment for patients with MG, and also that patients with thymomatous MG are likely to suffer a worse outcome than the ones with simple MG.

AB  - Thymectomy is now an established approach to the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). We used video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in thymectomy. From June 1993 to May 1995, we performed VATS thymectomy for 10 cases (6 males, 4 females with age ranging from 9 to 76 years). Complete thymectomy was achieved in every case by examination of the thymic bed and resected specimen. There was no mortality and complications were few. Average hospital stay was 4.1 days. Compared with the conventional median sternotomy approach, VATS was associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay and analgesic requirement. We believe that VATS thymectomy is technically feasible. However, its true role in the treatment of MG requires further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of video-assisted thoracic surgery for thymectomy with myasthenia gravis has not been examined. METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive patients underwent total thymectomy by video-assisted techniques between 1992 and 1995. There were 13 male and 20 female patients with a mean age of 38.42 +/- 16.88 years (range 9 to 84 years). The procedures were performed by either a right (n = 11) or left (n = 22) thoracoscopic approach and all anterior mediastinal tissue was removed. RESULTS: There was no perioperative mortality or long-term morbidity. One patient required conversion of the video-assisted technique to a lateral thoracotomy. All patients except one were extubated immediately. The mean hospital stay was 4.12 +/- 6.07 days (range 1 to 37 days) with a median of 3 days. Mean follow-up is 23.39 +/- 11.72 months (range 4 to 47 months). Clinical improvement was seen in 87.9% (29/33): one of two patients (50%) in stage I, 17 of 19 (89.4%) in stage IIA, eight of nine (88.8%) in stage IIB, and three of three (100%) in stage III. Metaanalysis of these results compared with results in nine published series in which other techniques were used showed no difference in clinical improvement after thymectomy between series. CONCLUSION: We conclude that video-assisted thymectomy is as effective as the traditional open surgical approaches for performance of thymectomy in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis. In addition, the improved cosmesis of the video-assisted approach ideally will lead to earlier thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of thymectomy on patients with generalised myasthenia gravis have been widely reported. However, there is no information on whether the experience of western countries can be generalised to the population of the Middle East. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis in a Middle East patient population and to identify clinical and histopathological factors associated with improved long term outcome of surgery. METHODS: In a prospective study, sixty three patients (aged 1.5-51 years) were treated in two university teaching hospitals between 1984 and 1991 and followed up for a mean of four years. Close communication was established with neurologists to obtain early referral. Radical anterior mediastinal dissection through a median sternotomy was performed in all patients. The response was evaluated by modified Osserman's classification. RESULTS: Eighteen patients achieved complete remission and a further 39 improved, producing an overall response rate of 90.5%. Patients with milder disease (stage II) had a higher response rate (97%) than those with more advanced disease (78%). Patients operated on with less than three years of symptoms had a better outcome (94%) than those with longer duration of preoperative symptoms, especially in non-thymomatous patients. Age and sex had no effect on the outcome. There was no effect on response rate if patients had hyperplastic or non-specific thymic histological findings, but patients with thymoma fared worse. CONCLUSIONS: These results are comparable with reports from the western world and represent the first prospective study from the Middle East. Thymectomy is indicated for all patients suffering from generalised myasthenia gravis soon after the diagnosis is made, regardless of age, stage, thymic pathology, and preoperative clinical status.

AB  - The authors have conducted a retrospective study on 115 patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing transsternal or transcervical thymectomy at the Policlinico A. Gemelli of Rome in the period June 1984- to June 1991. A prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation immediately and a few days following surgery was required respectively in 7 and 3 patients, while atelectasia and broncopneumonia have developed in 10 patients. No relationship could be established between the incidence of respiratory complications and factors such as preoperative symptomatology and treatment anesthetic agents, the surgical approach to the thymus and thymic pathology. However a significantly greater postoperative morbidity has been observed in the group of patients receiving suxametonium as compared to the patients receiving non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Vecuronium and atracurium very frequently allowed ad adequate resumption of spontaneous respiration after anesthesia and made possible a safe early extubation of patients before leaving the operating room. The authors also stressed that all patients, irrespective of their clinical conditions, must be transferred after thymectomy. Oto the surgical ICU where anticholinesterase therapy can be safely restarted and cardiorespiratory status carefully monitored.

AB  - Sixty-nine patients with generalized myasthenia gravis underwent thymectomy consecutively between 1980 and 1991 and were evaluated 1 month to 120 months after operation. Extended thymectomy was performed in 43 patients and other procedures in 26. The effect of thymectomy were as follows: 14.5% of the patients achieved complete remission (no symptoms, no medication), 73.9% showed improvement; in total 88.4% had palliation. The long-term changes of the remission rate at one and five years after operation were 11.5% and 19.2%, and showed a delayed remission. The long-term changes of the improvement and palliation rate were 55.7% and 67.2% at one year, 69.2% and 88.5% at five years after operation. There was significant difference in remission rate according to age at the time of operation and age of onset, but the response did not depend on sex, presence or absence of thymoma, preoperative duration of illness, Osserman's type and operative procedure.

AB  - The results of thymectomy in 282 patients with acquired and generalised myasthenia gravis are presented. The study includes patients submitted to surgical treatment in the period between 1958 and 1990. Remission or marked improvement was obtained in 70% of the patients with follow-up extending from one to 25 years. The total post-operative mortality rate was 8% dying predominantly patients with thymoma. Median sternotomy was made in 278 patients, transcervical thymectomy in two patients and thyroidectomy with concomitant thymectomy in other two. Surgical methods, operatory phases, previous treatment with prednisone and long term evolution with final results are discussed.

AB  - A multicentre retrospective study was carried out on the characteristics and course of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Italy. Data from 1152 patients, fairly representative of the myasthenic population seeking medical advice, were analysed for diagnostic criteria, clinical aspects and therapeutic approaches. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up, 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%, remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms, the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%, mostly in women, younger than age 40, and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease, mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus. MG was lethal in 4% of patients, principally men, older than 40, in grade 3 or worse at first observation, with a short history of disease, and with thymona.

AB  - Thymectomy was performed for myasthenia gravis on 30 patients, using a new approach with a collar incision which gave full exposure of the retrothyroid space and was directly connected to a median sternotomy. The thymus was removed en bloc without pleural incision. There was no perioperative mortality and the only complications were transient respiratory insufficiency in two cases. The postoperative hospital stay was 3-9 (mean 5.8) days. The effect of thymectomy was evaluated after 2-8 years at the Department of Neurology, when changes in symptoms (stages I-IV) or medication (need for cholinesterase inhibitors) were registered. The total clinical improvement rate was 97%, with 3% of the patients improved three stages, 33% two stages and 60% one stage compared with the preoperative classification. Twenty patients (67%) were asymptomatic at follow-up and six (20%) also required no medication. The medication need was reduced in 70% of cases (mean reduction 42%). Our cervicothoracic approach resulted in the same rate of improvement as in studies using more extensive transsternal procedures, but the morbidity was lower, with no complications requiring prolonged hospital stay. The morbidity was also less than after only transcervical procedures aiming to perform total thymectomy--a prerequisite for maximal and lasting benefit from surgery. Moreover, as this cervicothoracic approach is simple and safe, it can be recommended as an option in the surgical management of myasthenia gravis.

AB  - Seventeen cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with thymoma were studied clinically, histologically, and immunologically. Two cases were associated with myasthenia gravis (MG), and three with hypogammaglobulinemia. Coombs test and antinucleus antibody test were positive in five cases. All thymomas were spindle cell types, and the adjacent thymuses had no germinal center, but showed epithelial clusters frequently. All patients, except one whose tumor was unresectable, had thymo-thymomectomy. The operation was effective in six cases (37.5%), and the effects were not different between two operative procedures (simple and extended thymectomy). Myasthenic symptoms in two patients remitted after the operation, but effects on hypogammaglobulinemia were conincident with those on PRCA.

AB  - A new surgical technique for thymectomy is presented. Three hundred and seventeen patients with myasthenia gravis and 20 with thymomas who had myasthenic symptoms were operated on. The new surgical approach--a small transverse sternotomy--was used in 257 cases (in 240 patients with myasthenia gravis and 17 with thymomas) and conventional median sternotomy in 80. In myasthenic patients small transverse sternotomy enabled radical thymectomy to be performed with an uneventful postoperative course and very good cosmetic results. There were no hospital deaths among patients with myasthenia gravis after thymectomy. The long term results, assessed after 18-24 months, were good: the total remission rate was 39.5%, and there was a great improvement in 48.5% and an improvement in 9%. After thymectomy about 30% of patients received supplementary treatment with prednisone. A correlation between the duration of symptoms and the result of thymectomy was established: the shorter the duration of myasthenia gravis the better the results. In the small group of 20 patients with thymomas two died in hospital. In 12 patients with encapsulated thymic tumours the long term results were similar to those in patients with myasthenia gravis, whereas in patients with infiltrating thymic tumours the results were unsatisfactory.

AB  - Over the last 14 years we have thymectomized 106 myasthenic patients, 62 by transcervical and 44 by transsternal approach. At the end of the follow-up 49 patients (46.2%) had improved, 12 of these (11.2%) being in remission. Our data supply no guidance regarding the prognosis of individual patients at the time of thymectomy. In our hands neither operation seemed to modify the natural course of myasthenia gravis.

AB  - Forty-eight consecutive patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) attended by generalized weakness were treated by complete thymectomy, performed transsternally in 46 patients and through a left thoracotomy in two with thymomas. There were no operative deaths. A 12-year-old child with fulminating MG died of acute pneumonia shortly after hospital discharge. Of the remaining 47 evaluable patients, thymectomy resulted in complete remission in six, marked improvement with a reduced need for medication in 20, and mild improvement on the same dosage of medication in 18. Neither the age of the patient, nor the histopathology of the excised thymus, nor the postoperative change in acetylcholine receptor antibody titer were found to have a significant influence on the response to thymectomy. If the ten patients who were 20 years of age or younger were excluded, the patients with a shorter duration of MG achieved a better response to operation. The authors conclude that thymectomy is effective treatment for MG, regardless of the age of the patient or the type of thymic pathology.

AB  - Persistence of symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis who have undergone previous thymectomy has been attributed to thymus remnants. Patients with partial or no recovery were studied 40 +/- 31 months (mean +/- SD) after surgery, which had been carried out by the transcervical approach in 20 and trans-sternal approach in four. Lateral x-ray tomography of the mediastinum after injection of air showed images compatible with residual thymus gland in 18 patients (75 percent). Thirteen of these underwent reoperation by the trans-sternal approach, and thymic tissue was found in 11 (85 percent). After repeated thymectomy, 67 percent of the patients improved clinically. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to infer that incomplete removal of the thymus was responsible, at least partly, for failure of the first procedure.

AB  - Thymectomy was performed on 249 patients with myasthenia gravis between 1957 and 1981. During a follow-up period that ranged from 2 months to 24 years (mean 7.5 years), the remission rate for the entire group was 51%, and an additional 36% had improvement (87% benefited). In those 51 patients with thymoma, the remission rate was 37%, with 68% of the patients benefiting from operations. The remaining 198 patients fared better after the operation: 54% had remission and a total of 91% benefited. The female patients within this group had a 94% probability of benefit from operation. We conclude that most patients with myasthenia gravis will benefit from thymectomy, and that the improvement persists over an extended period of time in a high percentage of patients.

AB  - Thymectomy was performed on 240 myasthenic patients (60 thymomatous and 180 non-thymomatous ones). The removal of the thymus or of the thymoma was made in 206 cases by transcervical approach (136 with a little sternal split). The postoperative course after transcervical approach presented minimal risks (only 6-8% prolonged assisted respiration and 1.4% postoperative death). Total remission at the end of the third postoperative year was 12% and improvement was observed in 55% out of the first 100 operated cases. Best results were obtained in the youngest patients without thymoma, with absent or rare germinal centers and when thymus was removed early.

AB  - Good results were obtained in 80% of 248 patients seen after more than 15 mth following the operation. Results are grouped as a function of the different characteristic features of the patients and 3 groups can be defined: failures, improvements, remissions. These results contradict those who assert that thymectomy is of no value for severe cases. Cervicotomy is performed for non-tumoral forms or for small tumors; sternotomy is reserved for large median thymomas; anterolateral thoracotomy for laterally located thymomas and tracheotomized patients. Postoperative tracheotomy is very rarely needed. Patients are followed-up by clinical signs and ergodynamometric tracings. The prognosis for the myasthenia is not affected by the presence or absence of germinating centers in the nontumoral thymus, or by the benign nature of the thymoma. Small undiagnosed tumors may be discovered during operation. Treatment of recurrences is difficult. The myasthenia may be associated with other autoimmune affections. The indication for operation in the purely ocular forms is debatable. Thymectomy may produce total remission even in severe cases, and may improve the results of medical treatment. Even in case of failure it can reduce the severity of the course of the disease.

AB  - In myasthenia 10 to 15% thymomas were found; hyperplasias were identifiable in myasthenic patients without thymomas. Twentythree thymectomies were performed. A classification is presented: stage I is purely ocular, stage IV is the final stage with involvement of respiratory and deglutition musculature. Access is either by median sternotomy or Kocher's collar incision with partial sternotomy; a purely cervical access involves a minimum load or burden. Tracheotomy was omitted on principle (it was only carried out once preoperatively and twice postoperatively). The article deals with 4 thymomas and 12 thymus hyperplasias, there were 2 postoperative deaths (one malignant thymoma, one stage IV, both with tracheotomy complications). In 18 followups (the averge time interval was 7.5 yr) five complete remissions, 10 considerable improvements and two unimproved cases were found. Drug therapy with azathioprin was additionally effective in isolated cases.

AB  - Thymectomy is one of the best therapies for myasthenia gravis. 120 patients with myasthenia gravis (83 without thymoma and 37 with thymoma) had been thymectomized in our clinic. The 'trans-sternal simple thymectomy' (SST) was performed for 19 cases without thymoma and the 'trans-cervical simple thymectomy' (CST), for 18 cases. In this study, the prognosis of these two groups, namely SST and CST groups, was compared for the purpose of clarifying which is the more effective method for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. The result is the following: The prognosis of the SST group was better than that of the CST group. In the SST group, the longer the post-operative time was, the more both remission and improvement cases were. However, this phenomenon was not found in the CST group. From the above results, it is concluded that the SST should be recommended for myasthenia gravis rather than the CST.

AB  - Thymectomy is important in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Total removal of the gland is considered indicated. Although median sternotomy has been the accepted surgical procedure, the transcervical approach has been advocated as a safer method of achieving total thymectomy. A surgical-anatomical study of the thymus was made in 22 patients. A high incidence of surgically important variations in thymic anatomy was found in the neck and in the mediastinum. The authors believe wide exposure by way of median sternotomy with direct vision is required to remove all of the extracapsular mediastinal thymus in many patients, and good cervical exposure is required to remove the anomalous tissue in the neck. If a total thymectomy is to be achieved, they recommend a median sternotomy and a cervical incision, using the meticulous dissection described.

AB  - The role played by the surgical route on the immediate post-operative course has been studied on the basis of personal experience of thymectomy for myasthenia gravis (75 operated cases). Time of respiratory assistance, pleuropulmonary complications, operative mortality and recourse to trachetomy were evaluted in two homogenous groups of patients thymectomized cervically (group I: 36 cases) or trans-sternally (group II: 39 cases). It is was found that the average duration of respiratory assistance was significatly less in the first than in the second group (it was often not necessary at all), pleuropulmonary complications were halved, tracheotomy was never indicated and operative mortality was nil. The cervical approach thus offers enormous functional advantages and devers a leading place in surgery of the thymus; it would appear to be contraindicated only in the presence of radiologically evident thymomas and at times in cases where tracheotomy has been performed previously.

AB  - During the period 1970-1976, 336 thymectomies were performed on patients with myasthenia gravis - 320 by the transcervical and 16 by the sternal split approach. Up to 1975, all patients routinely went to the surgical/respiratory intensive care unit. For the first nine months of 1975, 34 of 41 patients were in the intensive care unit for only one day. Most of these patients were in Class 1A and 2. No patient had to return for intensive care. Therefore in October 1975, Class 1A, 2A and 2B patients were sent to the recovery room post-operatively. During the last three months of 1975, the patients were returned to the general surgical units of the hospital without mishap. All Class 3 and 4 patients and those who had sternal splitting procedures, were admitted to the I.C.U. There was no mortality. Patients who required anticholinesterase therapy were usually given a reduced dose prior to surgery and continued on their normal schedule post-operatively. A 'demand' dose of Pyridostigmine IV was given if sudden weakness developed post-operatively. Relaxants were not used as part of the anesthetic technique. During the last 15 months, (10/1/75 thru 12/31/76) 8 patients who were admitted to the I.C.U. required prolonged ventilation.

AB  - Eighty patients suffering from myasthenia gravis and subjected to thymectomy in the last three yr have been investigated. The operation was performed through a trans-cervical incision in 56 out of 59 patients without thymoma, and in 11 out of 21 patients with thymoma. Thymectomy or thymomectomy is one of the most effective treatments for myasthenia gravis. Since one third of the patients with myasthenia gravis have thymomas and only one third of these are detectable with pneumomediastinography, all patients suffering from myasthenia gravis should be submitted to surgical exploration of the thymic bed. With the trans-cervical approach and an accurate administration of anticholinesterase drugs before and after operation, only 2-3% of these patients need prolonged assisted respiration, which is reserved for those patients with serious respiratory involvement. After six mth 54.9% of these patients improved or are in remission; this percentage became higher after 12 mth (68.2%). Sex, age or the severity of the condition do not influence the result of treatment; on the contrary, the percentage of patients who are improved or are in remission is higher in those cases with rare or absent germinal centres or who are operated on early in the course of the disease. Only 2 cases had more severe symptoms following thymectomy and only 2 patients died post-operatively. In the patents with unchanged symptoms or with a deterioration following an initial improvement, medical treatment with cortisone or ACTH gives good results in more than 50% of cases.

AB  - 37 women and 6 men with myasthenia gravis underwent thymectomy in the period 1958-1974 with no post operative mortality. Two patients had a thymoma. The rest were equally divided into one group with normal histology and one with hyperplasia. 87% of the women and 5 out of 6 of the men showed an effect of the operation graded from 'some' to 'excellent'. Severely ill patients seemed to benefit slightly less than those less affected. Short duration of symptoms in younger patients seems to give best results, but patients in their forties with longstanding illness may also benefit greatly. Most operations involved sternotomy, but in a few a suprasternal cross section was used and proved satisfactory. All patients managed in a respirator postoperatively.

AB  - A group of 71 patients with myasthenia gravis is reviewed. All were initially managed medically, and 18 underwent thymectomy. Twenty three responded poorly to drug treatment, and 7 died from respiratory failure. In contrast thymectomy was beneficial in 16 of the 18 who were subjected to operation. Seven patients had significant postoperative respiratory complications, and 9 required a tracheostomy. Thymectomy appears to be effective and safe and to be indicated in young patients with early disease, and in patients who do not respond to drug treatment. The transcervical approach to thymectomy was satisfactory on two occasions.
